# Organization Theory

A Libertarian Perspective

By Kevin A. Carson

To my mother, Ruth Emma Rickert, and the memory of my father, Amos Morgan Carson, with love.

# Preface

This book had it origins in a passage (the "Fiscal and Input Crises" section of Chapter Eight) of my last book, *Studies in Mutualist Political Economy*. If you read that passage (it's available online at Mutualist.Org), you'll get an idea of the perspective that led me to write this book. The radical thoughts on organizational pathologies in that passage, both my own and those of the writers I quoted, dovetailed with my experiences of bureaucratic irrationality and Pointy-Haired Bossism in a lifetime as a worker and consumer.

To get the rest of the questions on my perspective out of the way, I should mention that the wording of the subtitle ("A Libertarian Perspective") reflects a long process of indecision and changes, and is something I still find unsatisfactory. I vacillated between the adjectives "mutualist," "anarchist," "individualist anarchist," and "left-libertarian," not really satisfied with any of them because of their likely tendency to pigeonhole my work or scare away my target audience. I finally ended up (with some misgivings) with plain old "Libertarian." It's a term of considerable contention between the classical liberal and libertarian socialist camps. I don't mean the choice of term in a sense that would exclude either side. In fact, as an individualist in the tradition of Tucker and the rest of the Boston anarchists, I embrace *both* the free market libertarian and libertarian socialist camps. I chose "libertarian" precisely it was large and contained multitudes: it alone seemed sufficiently broad to encompass the readership I had in mind.

I write from the perspective of individualist anarchism, as set forth by William B. Greene and Benjamin Tucker among others, and as I attempted to update it for the twenty-first century in my last book. Here's how I described it in the Preface to that book:

In the mid-nineteenth century, a vibrant native American school of anarchism, known as individualist anarchism, existed alongside the other varieties. Like most other contemporary socialist thought, it was based on a radical interpretation of Ricardian economics. The classical individualist anarchism of Josiah Warren, Benjamin Tucker and Lysander Spooner was both a socialist movement and a subcurrent of classical liberalism. It agreed with the rest of the socialist movement that labor was the source of exchange-value, and... entitled to its full product. Unlike the rest of the socialist movement, the individualist anarchists believed that the natural wage of labor in a free market was its product, and that economic exploitation could only take place when capitalists and landlords harnessed the power of the state in their interests. Thus, individualist anarchism was an alternative both to the increasing statism of the mainstream socialist movement, and to a classical liberal movement that was moving toward a mere apologetic for the power of big business.[^1]

I belong to the general current of the Left so beautifully described by the editors of *Radical Technology* ("the 'recessive Left' of anarchists, utopians and visionaries, which tends only to manifest itself when dominant genes like Lenin or Harold Wilson are off doing something else"). As such, I tend to agree with the Greens and other left-wing decentralists on the evils to which they object in current society and on their general view of a good society, while I agree with free market libertarians on their analysis of the cause of such evils and how to get from here to there. In short: green ends with libertarian means.

My analysis of the large organization is informed by the same principles as my study of the state capitalist economy, namely: 1) that the exercise of power creates conflict of interest, within the nominally "private" corporation as well as in the larger economy; 2) hierarchy, by separating authority from knowledge, leads to the same informational problems within an organization that Hayek described at the level of political economy; and 3) by externalizing effort and reward on different actors, authority creates fundamental incentive problems. The primary function of authority is to create privilege: the wielder of power is able to externalize the costs of his decisions on others, while appropriating the benefits for himself. The result, when the costs and benefits of action are not internalized by the same actors, is that particular forms of organization are adopted beyond Pareto-optimal levels, and self-reinforcing distortions in feedback lead to a series of synergetic instabilities and interventions of the sort Mises described at the level of the economy as a whole. In short: state capitalism, along with the large, pathological organizations it breeds, is unsustainable.

The central question of Part One is that of Ronald Coase: If markets are more efficient than hierarchy and planning, why are the latter so prevalent? Why do we find the phenomenon that Coase remarked on--islands of corporate central planning in an economy supposedly governed by the market? Coase's answer was that firm boundaries--the boundaries between market and hierarchy--are set at the point at which the transaction costs of market contracting surpass than those of administration and planning. The subject of Part One is the extent to which the state artificially shifts these boundaries upward, so that the size of the dominant organization is far larger than warranted by genuine considerations of efficiency.

Part Two (consisting of a single chapter, Four) considers the pathological effects of large size, centralization and hierarchy, on a systemic level, under the hegemony of the corporation and the centralized state. That is, it considers the effect of the predominance of the large, hierarchical organization, and of the professionalized and bureaucratic culture it spawns, on the character of society as a whole.

Part Three examines the effects of large size and hierarchy *within* the large organization. Chapters Five and Six are brief surveys of the literature on information and incentive problems within the large organization, both by conventional organization theorists and by radical thinkers like Robert Anton Wilson and Paul Goodman. Chapter Seven applies the Austrian critique of central planning to the corporation. Chapter Eight is a broad-ranging examination of the irrationality and authoritarianism of the large organization, and of the general pathologies of managerialism: in particular, it is a critique of the currently prevailing MBA model of downsizing human capital, stripping assets, and gutting long-term productive capabilities in order to game management bonuses and stock options. Chapter Nine is a study of the internal crisis of governability of the large corporation, and--based on conventional literature on incomplete contracting--applies an asymmetric warfare model to labor relations within the corporation. And Chapter Ten examines the broad range of management theory and reform gimmicks, which I argue either serve as a mere legitimizing ideology of lip-service, or amount to an attempt to incorporate libertarian and decentralist elements into the old framework of corporate hierarchy rather than making them the building blocks of a fundamentally new form of society.

Finally, Part Four--of which I am especially proud--surveys the range of technical and organizational alternatives that might prevail in a decentralist, cooperative, genuinely free market economy. Chapters Eleven and Twelve discuss the twin structural principles of a genuinely libertarian society: the abolition of privilege and its replacement by a genuinely free market governed by the unfettered operation of the cost principle. Chapter Thirteen discusses the most feasible process for dismantling the state and moving toward such a society, summed up by the Wobbly slogan "Building the structure of the new society within the shell of the old." Chapter Fourteen examines the technological building blocks of a decentralized economy (especially small-scale general-purpose production machinery, desktop production machinery, and community-supported agriculture) based on small-scale production for local markets. Chapters Fifteen and Sixteen, finally, examine the organizational building blocks of production (cooperatives, peer production, and the informal and household economies) and distribution.

This book, for better or worse, is an example of peer production. The chapters have all appeared as rough drafts online, and much of the material within them appeared before that as posts on my blog (*Mutualist Blog: Free Market Anti-Capitalism*). The final form of this book reflects the enormous amount of fruitful discussion in the comments at my blog, and the helpful questions and criticisms raised by my readers, and the insights I have gained from dialogue with other organization theory bloggers and writers. I've received invaluable help in identifying typos and other errors from readers (particularly Matthieu Gues) who have compiled painstaking errata lists from reading the online drafts. Both the pdf I submitted to the publisher and the beautiful cover design are the work of Gary Chartier. So in many ways this is a collaborative product, and I owe my readers a debt of gratitude.

I welcome questions and criticisms. I can be reached by email at <free.market.anticapitalist@gmail.com>.

# Part One

State Capitalist Intervention in the Market

# Chapter One

A Critical Survey of Orthodox Views on Economy of Scale

Herbert Simon remarked that, to an observer from Mars, "the dominant feature of the [economic] landscape" would be, not the market, but large organizations.[^2] Or as David Friedman put it, "The capitalist system of coordination by trade seems to be largely populated by indigestible lumps of socialism called corporations."[^3] The dominance of that feature, those lumps, is the central theme of Part One: the ways in which the state intervenes in the market to promote the predominance of organizations that are excessively large (i.e., larger than the efficiency considerations of a free market would justify). In the process, it will be helpful to keep in mind questions raised by R.H. Coase seventy years ago:

As D. H. Robertson points out, we find "islands of conscious power in this ocean of unconscious co-operation like lumps of butter coagulating in a pail of buttermilk." But in view of the fact that it is usually argued that co-ordination will be done by the price mechanism, why is such organization necessary? Why are there these "islands of conscious power"?[^4]

What determines the boundaries between firm and market? Why is there any substitution of hierarchy for independent contracts at all, and, conversely, why is there not one big firm?

The main reason why it is profitable to establish a firm would seem to be that there is a cost of using the price mechanism.... The costs of negotiating and concluding a separate contract for each exchange transaction which takes place on a market must also be taken into account.... It is true that contracts are not eliminated when there is a firm but they are greatly reduced. A factor of production (or the owner thereof) does not have to make a series of contracts with the factors with whom he is co-operating within the firm.... For this series of contracts is substituted one....

....A firm becomes larger as additional transactions (which could be exchange transactions co-ordinated through the price mechanism) are organized by the entrepreneur and becomes smaller as he abandons the organization of such transactions. The question which arises is whether it is possible to study the forces which determine the size of the firm. Why does the entrepreneur not organize one less transaction or one more?....

The answer is that the maximum boundary of the firm is determined by the point "where the costs of organizing an extra transaction within the firm are equal to the costs involved in carrying out the transaction in the open market..."

...[Therefore], a firm will tend to expand until the costs of organizing an extra transaction within the firm will become equal to the costs of carrying out the same transaction by means of an exchange on the open market or the costs of organizing in another firm.[^5]

In this chapter we will survey the conventional view of economy of scale, primarily as expounded by technocratic liberals like Alfred Chandler and John Kenneth Galbraith. We will examine its pathological implications for the organization of the political economy as a whole, along with its unstated assumptions and value judgments and its internal contradictions.

In Chapter Two, we will examine the available evidence on economy of scale, which shows not only that the dominant firm is many times larger than would be warranted by efficiency considerations, but that its size results in significant net inefficiency costs compared to the smaller firm. The obvious question arises, in response to this finding: if the large firm is less efficient, why does it exist?

The answer, found in Chapter Three, is that the state makes it artificially efficient by subsidizing its inefficiency costs and insulating it from competition, and thereby artificially shifts the boundary between market and hierarchy.

A. Cross-Ideological Affinity for Large-Scale Organization

Technocratic liberals, in their analysis of American industrial history, have tended to assume the superior efficiency of large-scale organization, and to accept "economies of scale" as a sufficient explanation for the rise of the large corporation from a supposedly "laissez-faire" economy. In the words of Randall Meyer,

[The] problems of our times will require greater, bigger organizations than we have now, rather than smaller ones, for their solution.... [We must therefore] cast aside our outmoded notions of size and our fear of bigness.[^6]

Of course this assumption is not limited to liberal managerialists. It is shared by both the vulgar Marxists (who see One Big Trust as the penultimate stage in the progressive development toward state socialism), and the vulgar Austrians (who equate capital-intensiveness or "roundaboutness" as such with superior productivity).

Among the Marxists, it can be found in the work of Marx and Engels themselves. In *The Communist Manifesto*, they identified the concentration of capital and the centralization of production, as such, with the progressive role of the bourgeoisie:

The bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state of the population, of the means of production, and of property. It has agglomerated population, centralised the means of production, and has concentrated property in a few hands....

The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together. Subjection of Nature's forces to man, machinery, application of chemistry to industry and agriculture, steam-navigation, railways, electric telegraphs, clearing of whole continents for cultivation, canalisation of rivers, whole populations conjured out of the ground --- what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labour?[^7]

For the Marxists, economic centralization is a natural process that proceeds until the increasingly efficient system of large-scale production can no longer be contained by the "capitalist integument."

Engels took this tendency of Marxism even further, laying the groundwork for Lenin's later embrace of Taylorism[^8]:

If man... has subdued the forces of nature, the latter avenge themselves upon him by subjecting him, in so far as he employs them, to a veritable despotism independent of all social organisation. Wanting to abolish authority in large-scale industry is tantamount to wanting to abolish industry itself, to destroy the power loom in order to return to the spinning wheel....

We have thus seen that, on the one hand, a certain authority, no matter how delegated, and, on the other hand, a certain subordination, are things which, independently of all social organisation, are imposed upon us together with the material conditions under which we produce and make products circulate.

We have seen, besides, that the material conditions of production and circulation inevitably develop with large-scale industry and large-scale agriculture, and increasingly tend to enlarge the scope of this authority.[^9]

Lenin, like Engels, saw "state capitalist monopoly" as a progressive development, with the final progressive step being the expropriation of the ultra-efficient trusts by the workers' state: "..socialism is merely state-capitalist monopoly which is made to serve the interests of the whole people....."[^10]

On the right, the identification of large scale with efficiency is shared by some Austrian economists, who seem to think that capital-intensiveness (or "roundabout" production methods) involves unlimited, or almost unlimited efficiencies. The distinction originated with Böhm-Bawerk:

That roundabout methods lead to greater results than direct methods is one of the most important and fundamental propositions in the whole theory of production. It must be emphatically stated that the only basis of this proposition is the experience of practical life. Economic theory does not and cannot show *a priori,* that it must be so; but the unanimous experience of all the technique of production says that it is so.[^11]

The same assumption was restated, more forcefully, by Robert Murphy in his lecture "Capital and Interest":

*The more roundabout processes are, the more efficient and physically productive they are.

*The greater productivity of roundabout methods is why *Capital Accumulation* generates great wealth.[^12]

Lew Rockwell charged that "many people today... long for a system of economics that prevailed in the Middle Ages."

On the Left, we have the neo-Rousseauians who imagine that modern technology has a hopelessly corrupting effect, while many on the Right dream of a guild-dominated system of small craftsmen and home-based production. But these fantasies are not only unworkable; in reality, they are nothing short of lethal. Most of the world's population would die immediately if such a system were imposed.[^13]

This howler indicates that he knows next to nothing about the technical possibilities of home-based and small shop production using modern power machinery, or about the greater productivity per acre of intensive small-scale agriculture (about both of which see the material below on Ralph Borsodi).

At the crudest extreme is George Reisman. A central theme in his work runs something like this: the way to increase the standard of living is to make the rich even richer, so they will undertake the capital accumulation that alone increases the productivity of labor, which will cause wages to rise.[^14]

The irony is that the Austrians, who consider themselves such iconoclasts in savaging so much of the received wisdom of neoclassical economics and liberal managerialism, also accept without any critical awareness so many of its implicit assumptions. The Austrians are remarkably selective, to say the least, in their choices of which "conventional wisdom" to reject. But then consistency is not exactly the Austrians' strong suit. Their approach to deciding which parts of present-day reality to blame on the state, and which to credit to the wonders of the "free market," is (to say the least) somewhat arbitrary. The denizens of Lew Rockwell.Com and Mises.Org, when it comes to politics, resemble nothing so much as American Jacobites in their patronage of lost causes, standing athwart history and yelling "Stop!" on behalf of such might-have-beens as the Anti-Federalists and the southern secessionists. So it's somewhat jarring to see them turn on a dime and become ardently triumphalist enthusiasts for the sheer Hegelian "is-ness" of things when it comes to Wal-Mart and sweatshops. It's a bit odd to be so anti-Hamiltonian, and yet so fond of an economy founded on Hamiltonianism.
