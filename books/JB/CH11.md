## CHAPTER 11

MMT Won't Fix It

### Introduction

The great risk of fiscal dominance is inflation. For the simple reason that central banks have lost control of their official mandate: price stability. In Weimar Germany, this led to hyperinflation, and in the COVID-era Europe to inflation rates above 10 percent.

But what if inflation were not a problem? What if governments could run endless deficits to buy economic growth without triggering runaway price increases? That is precisely what Modern Monetary Theory promises. A dream scenario for governments worldwide struggling to keep the debt economy afloat.

Or is it just a fairytale?

### Modern Monetary Theory: What Is It?

Modern Monetary Theory, or MMT, is an economic theory that claims that sovereign countries controlling their own currency, like the United States with the dollar or Japan with the yen, can never truly go bankrupt. Governments in such countries can always create more money to pay their bills. The ability to print money without limit means governments are not dependent on tax revenues or borrowing. In fact, under MMT, taxes, and not interest rates, serve as the main instrument to manage inflation. If inflation is too high, governments raise taxes, reducing consumer spending power. If inflation is too low, taxes are lowered to stimulate spending.

Under MMT, the choice between raising taxes or issuing government bonds to finance the budget is entirely political. The government can simply finance its expenditures by issuing new money. Interest rates are incidental. At least in theory, since MMT favors lower rates so that interest payments do not constrain public spending. Debt servicing costs have to be financed as well, but for a sovereign government, technically this can't be a problem. Under MMT, a central bank, like the tax authority, is nothing more than an institution facilitating the way governments wish to finance their spending.

Hedge fund manager and entrepreneur Warren Mosler is the founder of the ideas behind MMT. He developed his theory in 1992 and published it a year later in a book titled *Soft Currency Economics*. Mosler argued that central banks and governments had long worked together to finance budgets. But he did not invent the name "Modern Monetary Theory." Bill Mitchell, an Australian economist, coined the term. Together with Mosler and co-developer Randall Wray, he expanded the theory in the 1990s.

Here lies one of the key criticisms of MMT. While the theory has attracted academic attention, it never made it into the most prominent economic journals. This contrasts with the earlier work of Solow (economic growth model, Chapter 2) and Domar (r--g formula, Chapter 5).

MMT really rose to prominence only when economics professor Stephanie Kelton, former adviser to Bernie Sanders during his 2016 presidential campaign, put it at the center of her 2020 book *The Deficit Myth*. In this book, Kelton argues that government budget deficits are no problem for countries issuing their own currency. According to Kelton, instead of obsessing over balancing the budget, governments should focus on economic and social goals, including full employment. The real issue is not inflation, but political reluctance to pursue those goals.

### Money Creation and Inflation -- A Journey Through Time

MMT is a relatively young theory. It has barely been tested academically and is viewed as unorthodox, which need not be a drawback, contrary to what many mainstream economists assume. The theory is descriptive: governments cannot go bankrupt because they can always print more of their currency. But at the same time normative: governments should spend as much as possible to achieve full employment and other goals until inflation arrives. It is this latter element that makes MMT hard to test.

Attempts to verify MMT have therefore focused on the relationship between money growth and inflation. The theory's starting point is that if governments use their central banks to print money to finance spending, this should not necessarily lead to inflation, especially when the goals of full employment and a fully functioning economy have not yet been achieved.

To assume that money creation does not cause inflation is a bold claim, however. It takes little effort to compile an impressive list of leading economic studies that provide rather convincing evidence that the relationship does exist. More money generally means more inflation. That assumption is one of the key foundations of fiscal dominance: central bank debt monetization results in higher inflation.

Because the link between money creation and inflation is decisive for determining whether we are dealing with fiscal dominance or MMT, I will summarize several groundbreaking and influential studies on this particular topic.

In 1911, Irving Fisher published *The Purchasing Power of Money*. Fisher, one of the founders of modern economics, formulated the "quantity theory of money." The theory looks like this:

**M × V = P × Y**

Where:

-   **M** = money supply, all the money in circulation in an economy,

-   **V** = velocity of money, how often a dollar or euro is spent in a year,

-   **P** = the aggregate price level,

-   **Y** = GDP, the size of the economy.

You can read the formula as follows: if the money supply (M) grows, then prices (P) will rise provided the other two factors (velocity, V, and economy, Y) remain constant. Fisher found in his work, focused on the United States, that money growth of 6 percent led to inflation of 5 percent. Fisher's book remains influential today because of its simple and direct link between money and inflation.

It is therefore no surprise that Milton Friedman, more than half a century later, drew on Fisher's work. In *A Monetary History of the United States, 1867--1960* (1963), co-written with Anna Schwartz, the Nobel Prize winner Friedman set out his now-famous dictum: "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon." According to Friedman, it is always central banks that cause inflation, even when it originates in fiscal policy and structural budget deficits. The book was revolutionary because it used historical data to prove that money growth drives inflation. In the 1920s, the U.S. money supply grew by 4 percent per year and inflation followed at 3.5 percent, while a 10 percent contraction in the money supply during the Great Depression of the 1930s produced price declines (deflation) of as much as 9 percent.

In 1972, Robert Lucas, also a Nobel Prize laureate, published *Expectations and the Neutrality of Money*. Lucas added a new dimension to the money-inflation relationship: expectations. People do not passively wait for government action or policy; they anticipate it. Lucas argued that only unexpected money growth causes inflation. In that case, people must adjust their expectations. In the U.S. of the 1960s, expected money growth of 3 percent had little impact on the real economy, but it did push prices higher, pushing inflation to 4 percent.

A few years later, in 1978, Robert Barro published *On the Determination of the Public Debt*. Barro, a Harvard economist and influential voice in macroeconomics, examined how governments finance debt: through money creation via central banks or via taxation. His research showed that when governments finance deficits through money creation, as the U.S. did in the 1970s, inflation tends to follow. Barro thus linked budget deficits directly to money growth and inflation, foreshadowing the theory of fiscal dominance that would be formally introduced a few years later with Sargent and Wallace's *Some Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic* (1981).

In 1993, John Taylor published *Discretion versus Policy Rules in Practice*. Taylor, a Stanford economist and the mind behind the "Taylor rule," demonstrated that central banks can contain inflation by adjusting interest rates in line with money growth. He argued that the inflation crisis of the early 1980s was explained by money growth, which had consistently exceeded 10 percent in the late 1970s. That crisis forced Fed Chairman Volcker to raise short-term rates to 20 percent. Once that happened, inflation quickly collapsed. Taylor's work is important because it shows central banks can use rates to manage inflation (monetary dominance) and that problems arise when they cannot freely do so (fiscal dominance).

In 1997, Michael Bordo and Anna Schwartz published *Monetary Policy Regimes and Economic Performance: The Historical Record*. Bordo, an expert in monetary history, and Schwartz, famous for her work with Friedman, analyzed an extensive historical dataset on money and inflation. They showed that stable money growth, such as during the gold standard (1870--1914), kept inflation low, while excessive money growth drove inflation higher, as in the 1970s. Their robust study demonstrated that the money--inflation relationship holds across eras.

Although Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff became infamous for an Excel error in their study of 800 years of financial crises, several of their conclusions remain rock-solid. One is that countries with high debt are more often confronted with ultra-high inflation levels. While under MMT, countries with their own currency cannot technically default, (hyper)inflation functions as an implicit default. Weimar Germany is again the classic example. Hyperinflation makes economies highly unstable and destroys wealth.

With an entire library of studies linking money supply and inflation, major institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Bank for International Settlements (BIS) have also added this subject to their research agendas. An IMF analysis from 2008 showed that in emerging markets, excessive money growth often leads to inflation. In 2001, Turkey's money supply expanded by 40 percent, accompanied by spectacular inflation rates of up to 70 percent. In recent years, we have seen virtually the same pattern in Turkey: average money growth of 50 percent since 2021 alongside 50 percent inflation. A related problem in emerging markets is that high inflation often triggers a currency collapse. Since 2021, the Turkish lira has lost more than 80 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar.

The long list of leading studies above at the very least warns that unlimited money creation almost certainly generates inflation, with a very real risk that it will spiral out of control.

### Well-Founded Objections

MMT has several features that, at least to me, raise more questions than they answer. Many of those same questions have also been raised by Harvard professor Greg Mankiw, author of *Macroeconomics*, a classic textbook that nearly every economics student (myself included) owns. Mankiw is one of MMT's fiercest critics, and in a 2020 article, *A Skeptic's Guide to Modern Monetary Theory*, he spelled out exactly why.

Of course, Mankiw highlighted the historical relationship between money growth and inflation. He finds that since 1870, there has been a positive correlation of 0.79 between the two variables. With a minimum value of -1 and a maximum of 1, that correlation approaches a perfect positive relationship. More money very often meant more inflation.

Mankiw's criticism goes further, focusing among other things on the rising interest costs of higher debt. When central banks print money to monetize government debt, that money often ends up as reserves in the banking system. Because banks do not always need those reserves, they deposit the surplus back at the central bank. The government, via the central bank, pays interest on those reserves. And so the cycle starts over again. To cover those (increased) interest payments, even more money must be created, further expanding the money supply.

Mankiw argues that paying interest is nothing more than an alternative form of borrowing. MMT proponents acknowledge this mechanism but conclude that interest rates should simply remain permanently low. In their view, that is a policy choice. Mankiw disagrees. If central banks pay too little interest on reserves, banks will lend more to businesses and households in the real economy. A low rate makes depositing reserves unattractive, so the money supply grows further. More money in the economy boosts demand, fueling inflation.

Another problem, according to Mankiw, is MMT's solution for inflation: government price controls. MMT assumes that inflation results from the struggle between workers and firms over income, and that the government resolves that struggle through wage and price regulation. This is difficult enough to understand, let alone to measure. The idea is that workers always want higher wages, while firms always want to raise prices to increase profits. When wages rise, firms will increase prices further to cover costs, leading workers to demand even higher wages in response, and so on. This creates a spiral of price increases. MMT casts the government as referee, breaking the spiral by imposing wage and price controls. Such a mechanism is far removed from the classical theory that prices are determined by supply and demand.

Mankiw finds this referee role unrealistic. Not surprising, since capitalism, dominant in many countries, is fundamentally opposed to government interference. Moreover, price controls have failed in the past, quickly leading to inefficiency and social tensions. In the United States in the 1970s, for example, they brought shortages and black markets, not stability.

The same applies to taxes as an instrument for controlling inflation. In practice, it is unworkable. Tax systems are too complex, and bureaucracy is too unwieldy. In some countries it takes years to change even a simple tax rule. In addition, as the Laffer curve in Chapter 7 showed, today's high tax burdens make capital flight likely. Recall the wealthy Norwegians who moved en masse to Switzerland. While under MMT governments do not technically need tax revenue to finance deficits, the flight of human capital is always undesirable, especially with a stagnating workforce.

MMT also underestimates the burning desire of politicians to be re-elected. Imagine the economy running at full capacity, everyone having a decent job (full employment), healthcare and social services being in excellent shape, defense spending comfortably above the new NATO target, and then inflation starts to rise. Do politicians facing an election say: "We're going to stop spending and raise taxes because MMT says so"? Probably not. As Kenneth Rogoff argued in his 2019 article *Modern Monetary Nonsense*, MMT ignores the political reality that politicians, driven by re-election, prefer to keep spending while avoiding unpopular measures like tax hikes.

A final criticism is that MMT inevitably leads to an ever-larger government. But how desirable is this? The larger the government, the less room there is for businesses to take risks and for individuals to make their own choices. Competition and innovation become policy-driven rather than market-driven. The government has rarely been a fertile ground for innovation. Traditionally, that role belonged to dusty attics filled with ambitious pioneers willing to take risks.

MMT undermines the last real source of growth: productivity. A system of controls, restrictions, and overregulation crowds out healthy economic incentives. The societal impact of an oversized government should not be underestimated. It would not be the first time that people revolted against it. This risk, moreover, is not limited to MMT. France and Japan are just two examples where fiscal dominance also produces bloated governments.

### Nagging Questions

On paper, MMT looks tempting: governments can print money to finance deficits without going bankrupt and without sparking inflation. But how this works in practice remains unclear to me. I am left with nagging questions, more often unanswered than answered.

Take inflation. MMT speaks of conflict inflation, in which workers demand higher wages and firms raise prices, setting off an income battle. The government can supposedly settle this conflict by raising taxes or fixing prices. But how do you measure this type of inflation, and what is the "right" price level? The standard basket of goods and services used to measure inflation does not fit here. MMT ignores the influence of supply and demand on store prices. And how do we deal with inflation that does arise from money creation (so-called monetary inflation)? In countries like Turkey, this has even led to hyperinflation, a phenomenon that MMT appears to systematically underestimate. The definition of conflict inflation quickly collides with reality.

What exactly is the role of central banks under this theory? MMT views them as executors of government policy, obliged to finance deficits and keep rates at zero. But central banks are, often by law, independent. Can governments force them? In Turkey, the government compelled the central bank to lower rates when the situation required the opposite, leading to a collapsing currency and hyperinflation. If central banks refuse and raise rates instead, isn't that a clear signal that inflation is spiraling out of control? This can create chaos in markets, with savings and bonds plunging in value.

Does MMT work everywhere? A sound theory should be universally applicable. The theory applies to countries with their own currency, like the U.S., China, or Japan. But in the eurozone, no country has its own currency; the euro is shared by economies with vastly different characteristics. The question also brings us back to the introduction of this book. In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Liz Truss was forced out after just 49 days in 2022, after a budget featuring massive unfunded tax cuts triggered chaos in financial markets. In countries with weak currencies, such as Argentina, Venezuela, and again Turkey, hyperinflation recurs regularly. Is MMT really that universal?

Who is still willing to buy government bonds at zero percent interest? Today, governments borrow from banks, firms, households, and foreign investors. MMT claims this is a choice. Yet in practice governments work hard to find enough buyers for their bonds. What is the real reason, if they can supposedly just turn on the printing press? U.S. Treasuries at least enjoy the artificial demand created by their role as a cornerstone of the current financial system. That ensures steady demand for U.S. debt. But in other countries that artificial demand does not exist. Why should investors continue buying, for example, French government bonds?

In short, MMT raises more questions than it answers. It promises an ideal world, but in practice the dynamics of deficits, central banks, money creation, and inflation are far more stubborn. And if MMT fails, inflation explodes, still leaving savers and bondholders to pay the price.

### MMT: A Vague, Surrealist Dream

Modern Monetary Theory promises a world where governments with their own currency can spend without limit and without worrying about inflation, perfect for any government struggling with debt sustainability. But I doubt MMT can withstand reality. Many aspects seem incomplete or not fully developed.

Moreover, the body of research linking money growth and inflation is overwhelming. The statistics do not favor MMT. It is an attractive experiment on paper, but risky in the real world. It ignores too many practical obstacles, from market dynamics to political reality, and that makes me highly skeptical.
