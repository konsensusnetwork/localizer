# CHAPTER 11: MMT Won't Fix It

### Introduction

The great risk of fiscal dominance is inflation, which occurs when central banks lose control of their official mandate: price stability. This led to hyperinflation in Weimar Germany and, in COVID-era Europe, to inflation rates above 10%.

But what if inflation were not a problem? What if governments could run endless deficits to buy economic growth without triggering runaway price increases? That is precisely what Modern Monetary Theory promises—a dream scenario for governments worldwide struggling to keep the debt economy afloat.

Or is it just a fairytale?

### Modern Monetary Theory: What Is It?

Modern Monetary Theory, or MMT, is an economic theory stating that sovereign countries that control their own currency—such as the United States with the dollar or Japan with the yen—can never truly go bankrupt. Governments in such countries can always create more money to pay their bills. The ability to print money without limit means governments are not dependent on tax revenues or borrowing. In fact, under MMT, taxes—not interest rates—serve as the main instrument to manage inflation. If inflation is too high, governments raise taxes, which reduces consumer spending power. If inflation is too low, taxes are lowered to stimulate spending.

Under MMT, the choice between raising taxes or issuing government bonds to finance the budget is entirely political. The government can simply finance its expenditures by issuing new money. Interest rates are incidental, although MMT favors lower rates so that interest payments do not constrain public spending. Debt servicing costs must also be financed, but for a sovereign government, this technically cannot be a problem. Under MMT, a central bank, like the tax authority, is nothing more than an institution facilitating how governments finance their spending.

Hedge fund manager and entrepreneur Warren Mosler is the founder of MMT. He developed his theory in 1992 and published it a year later in a book titled *Soft Currency Economics*. Mosler argued that central banks and governments had long worked together to finance budgets, but he did not invent the name Modern Monetary Theory. Bill Mitchell, an Australian economist, coined the term. Together with Mosler and co-developer Randall Wray, Mitchell expanded the theory in the 1990s.

This points to a key criticism of MMT. While the theory has attracted academic attention, it has never made it into the most prominent economic journals. This contrasts with the earlier work of Solow (economic growth model, Chapter 2) and Domar (r–g formula, Chapter 5).

MMT rose to prominence only when economics professor Stephanie Kelton, a former adviser to Bernie Sanders during his 2016 presidential campaign, placed it at the center of her 2020 book, *The Deficit Myth*. In this book, Kelton argues that government budget deficits are not a problem for countries issuing their own currency. According to Kelton, instead of obsessing over balancing the budget, governments should focus on economic and social goals, including full employment. The real issue is not inflation but political reluctance to pursue those goals.

### Money Creation and Inflation—A Journey Through Time

MMT is a relatively young theory. It has barely been tested academically and is viewed as unorthodox—which, contrary to what many mainstream economists assume, need not be a drawback. The theory is descriptive, positing that governments cannot go bankrupt because they can always print more of their currency. Yet it is also normative, arguing that governments should spend as much as possible to achieve full employment and other goals until inflation arrives. It is this latter element that makes MMT hard to test.

Attempts to verify MMT have therefore focused on the relationship between money growth and inflation. The theory's starting point is that if governments use their central banks to print money to finance spending, this should not necessarily lead to inflation, especially when the goals of full employment and a fully functioning economy have not yet been achieved.

However, to assume that money creation does not cause inflation is a bold claim. It takes little effort to compile an impressive list of leading economic studies that provide convincing evidence that the relationship exists. More money generally means more inflation. That assumption is one of the key foundations of fiscal dominance: central bank debt monetization results in higher inflation.

Because the link between money creation and inflation is decisive for distinguishing between fiscal dominance and MMT, I will summarize several groundbreaking and influential studies on this topic.

In 1911, Irving Fisher published *The Purchasing Power of Money*. Fisher, one of the founders of modern economics, formulated the “quantity theory of money.” The theory is expressed as follows:

**M × V = P × Y**

Where:

- **M** = money supply, all the money in circulation in an economy.

- **V** = velocity of money, how often a dollar or euro is spent in a year.

- **P** = the aggregate price level.

- **Y** = GDP, the size of the economy.

The formula can be read as follows: if the money supply (M) grows, then prices (P) will rise, provided the other two factors—velocity (V) and the economy (Y)—remain constant. In his work on the United States, Fisher found that money growth of 6% led to inflation of 5%. Fisher's book remains influential today because of its simple and direct link between money and inflation.

It is therefore unsurprising that Milton Friedman, more than half a century later, drew on Fisher's work. In *A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960* (1963), co-written with Anna Schwartz, Nobel laureate Milton Friedman set out his now-famous dictum: “Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.” According to Friedman, central banks are always the cause of inflation, even when it originates in fiscal policy and structural budget deficits. The book was revolutionary for its use of historical data to prove that money growth drives inflation. In the 1920s, the U.S. money supply grew by four percent per year and inflation followed at 3.5%, while a 10% contraction in the money supply during the Great Depression of the 1930s produced price declines (deflation) of as much as nine percent.

In 1972, Robert Lucas, another Nobel laureate, published *Expectations and the Neutrality of Money*. Lucas added a new dimension to the money–inflation relationship: expectations. People do not passively wait for government action or policy; they anticipate it. Lucas argued that only unexpected money growth causes inflation, as this is when people must adjust their expectations. In the United States during the 1960s, expected money growth of three percent had little impact on the real economy, but it pushed prices higher, driving inflation to four percent.

A few years later, in 1978, Robert Barro published *On the Determination of the Public Debt*. Barro, an influential Harvard macroeconomist, examined how governments finance debt: through money creation via central banks or through taxation. His research showed that when governments finance deficits through money creation, as the U.S. did in the 1970s, inflation tends to follow. Barro thus linked budget deficits directly to money growth and inflation, foreshadowing the theory of fiscal dominance formally introduced a few years later in Sargent and Wallace's *Some Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic* (1981).

In 1993, John Taylor published *Discretion versus Policy Rules in Practice*. Taylor, a Stanford economist known for creating the “Taylor rule,” demonstrated that central banks can contain inflation by adjusting interest rates in line with money growth. He argued that the inflation crisis of the early 1980s was caused by money growth, which had consistently exceeded 10% in the late 1970s. That crisis forced Fed Chairman Volcker to raise short-term rates to 20%. Inflation collapsed soon afterward. Taylor's work is important because it shows that central banks can use interest rates to manage inflation (monetary dominance) and that problems arise when they cannot freely do so (fiscal dominance).

In 1997, Michael Bordo and Anna Schwartz published *Monetary Policy Regimes and Economic Performance: The Historical Record*. Bordo, an expert in monetary history, and Schwartz, known for her work with Friedman, analyzed an extensive historical dataset on money and inflation. They showed that stable money growth, such as during the gold standard (1870–1914), kept inflation low, while excessive money growth drove inflation higher, as in the 1970s. Their robust study demonstrated that the money–inflation relationship holds across eras.

Although Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff became infamous for an Excel error in their study of 800 years of financial crises, several of their conclusions remain rock-solid. One is that countries with high debt more often face extremely high inflation. While countries with their own currency cannot technically default under MMT, (hyper)inflation functions as an implicit default. Weimar Germany is again the classic example. Hyperinflation makes economies highly unstable and destroys wealth.

With an entire library of studies linking money supply and inflation, major institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Bank for International Settlements (BIS) have also added this subject to their research agendas. An IMF analysis from 2008 showed that in emerging markets, excessive money growth often leads to inflation. In 2001, Turkey's money supply expanded by 40%, accompanied by inflation rates of up to 70%. In recent years, we have seen virtually the same pattern in Turkey: average money growth of 50% since 2021 alongside 50% inflation. A related problem in emerging markets is that high inflation often triggers a currency collapse. Since 2021, the Turkish lira has lost more than 80% of its value against the U.S. dollar.

The extensive research at the very least suggests that unlimited money creation almost certainly generates inflation, with a significant risk of it spiraling out of control.

### Well-Founded Objections

MMT has several features that, at least to me, raise more questions than they answer. Many of those same questions have also been raised by Harvard professor Greg Mankiw, author of *Macroeconomics*, a classic textbook that nearly every economics student (myself included) owns. Mankiw is one of MMT's fiercest critics, and in a 2020 article, *A Skeptic's Guide to Modern Monetary Theory*, he spelled out exactly why.

Of course, Mankiw highlighted the historical relationship between money growth and inflation. He finds that since 1870, there has been a positive correlation of 0.79 between the two variables. With the scale ranging from -1 to 1, that correlation approaches a perfect positive relationship—meaning more money has very often meant more inflation.

Mankiw extends his criticism to the rising interest costs of higher debt. When central banks print money to monetize government debt, that money often ends up as reserves in the banking system. Because banks do not always need those reserves, they deposit the surplus back at the central bank. The government, via the central bank, then pays interest on those reserves. This creates a feedback loop: to cover the increased interest payments, more money must be created, further expanding the money supply.

Mankiw argues that paying interest is nothing more than an alternative form of borrowing. MMT proponents acknowledge this mechanism but conclude that interest rates should simply remain permanently low, viewing this as a policy choice. Mankiw disagrees. He argues that if central banks pay too little interest on reserves, banks will lend more to businesses and households. A low rate makes depositing reserves unattractive, so banks will lend out the excess funds, expanding the money supply. This increased lending boosts demand and fuels inflation.

Another problem, according to Mankiw, is MMT's proposed solution for inflation: government price controls. MMT assumes that inflation results from a struggle between workers and firms over income, which the government resolves through wage and price regulation. The theory posits that workers always want higher wages, while firms want to raise prices to increase profits. When wages rise, firms increase their prices to cover costs, leading workers to demand even higher wages in response and creating a wage-price spiral. MMT casts the government in the role of a referee, breaking the spiral by imposing wage and price controls. Such a mechanism is far removed from the classical theory that prices are determined by supply and demand.

Mankiw finds this referee role unrealistic, partly because capitalism—the dominant system in many countries—is fundamentally opposed to such government interference. Moreover, price controls have failed in the past, leading to inefficiency and social tensions. In the United States in the 1970s, for example, they led to shortages and black markets, not stability.

The same applies to taxes as an instrument for controlling inflation; in practice, it is unworkable. Tax systems are too complex, and their bureaucracies too unwieldy. In some countries, it takes years to change even a simple tax rule. In addition, as the Laffer curve in Chapter 7 showed, today's high tax burdens make capital flight likely—recall the wealthy Norwegians who moved en masse to Switzerland. While governments under MMT do not technically need tax revenue to finance deficits, the flight of human capital is always undesirable, especially with a stagnating workforce.

MMT also underestimates the burning desire of politicians to be re-elected. Imagine an economy running at full capacity: everyone has a decent job, healthcare and social services are in excellent shape, defense spending is comfortably above the new NATO target, and then inflation starts to rise. Do politicians facing an election say, “We're going to stop spending and raise taxes because MMT says so”? Probably not. As Kenneth Rogoff argued in his 2019 article *Modern Monetary Nonsense*, MMT ignores the political reality that politicians, driven by re-election, prefer to keep spending while avoiding unpopular measures like tax hikes.

A final criticism is that MMT inevitably leads to an ever-larger government. But how desirable is this? The larger the government, the less room there is for businesses to take risks and for individuals to make their own choices. Competition and innovation become policy-driven rather than market-driven. The government has rarely been a fertile ground for innovation; that role has traditionally belonged to dusty attics filled with ambitious pioneers willing to take risks.

MMT undermines the last real source of growth: productivity. A system of controls, restrictions, and overregulation crowds out healthy economic incentives. The societal impact of an oversized government should not be underestimated, as it would not be the first time people have revolted against one. This risk, moreover, is not limited to MMT. France and Japan are just two examples where fiscal dominance also produces bloated governments.

### Nagging Questions

On paper, MMT looks tempting: governments can print money to finance deficits without going bankrupt or sparking inflation. In practice, however, its application raises nagging questions that often go unanswered.

Take inflation. MMT speaks of conflict inflation, in which workers demand higher wages and firms raise prices, setting off an income battle. The government can supposedly settle this conflict by raising taxes or fixing prices. But how is this type of inflation measured, and what constitutes the “right” price level? The standard basket of goods and services used for measurement does not apply here. MMT also seems to ignore the influence of supply and demand on consumer prices. Furthermore, it does not adequately address inflation arising from money creation (so-called monetary inflation). In countries like Turkey, monetary inflation has led to hyperinflation—a phenomenon that MMT appears to systematically underestimate. The theory’s narrow definition of conflict inflation quickly collides with reality.

What is the role of central banks under this theory? MMT views them as executors of government policy, obliged to finance deficits and keep interest rates at zero. But central banks are often independent by law. Can governments force them to comply? In Turkey, the government compelled the central bank to lower rates when the situation required the opposite, leading to a collapsing currency and hyperinflation. If a central bank were to refuse and raise rates instead, its defiance would signal that inflation is spiraling out of control, potentially creating chaos in markets as savings and bonds plunge in value.

Does MMT work everywhere? A sound theory should be universally applicable. The theory purports to apply to countries with their own currency, like the U.S., China, or Japan. But in the eurozone, no country has its own currency; the euro is shared by economies with vastly different characteristics. This limitation is critical. In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Liz Truss was forced out in 2022 after just 49 days, when her budget of massive unfunded tax cuts triggered chaos in financial markets. In countries with weak currencies—such as Argentina, Venezuela, and Turkey—hyperinflation recurs regularly. Is MMT really so universal?

Who would be willing to buy government bonds at 0% interest? Today, governments borrow from banks, firms, households, and foreign investors. MMT claims this is a choice, yet in practice, governments work hard to find enough buyers for their bonds. Why do so if they can supposedly just turn on the printing press? U.S. Treasuries, at least, enjoy artificial demand created by their role as a cornerstone of the financial system, which ensures a steady market for U.S. debt. In other countries, however, that artificial demand does not exist. Why, for example, should investors continue buying French government bonds?

In short, MMT raises more questions than it answers. It promises an ideal world, but in practice, the dynamics of deficits, central banks, money creation, and inflation are far more intractable. If MMT fails, runaway inflation will leave savers and bondholders to pay the price.

### MMT: A Vague, Surrealist Dream

Modern Monetary Theory promises a world where governments with their own currency can spend without limit and without worrying about inflation—an ideal solution for any government struggling with debt sustainability. However, many aspects of the theory seem incomplete or underdeveloped, casting doubt on its real-world application.

Moreover, the body of research linking money growth and inflation is overwhelming, and the statistics do not favor MMT. While an attractive experiment on paper, it is a risky proposition in the real world. The theory ignores too many practical obstacles, from market dynamics to political realities, making its viability highly questionable.
