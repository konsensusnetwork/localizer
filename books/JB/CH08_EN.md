**CHAPTER 8**

Exponential spending

**Introduction**

Any good accountant will tell you that there's another effective way to get your budget in order: spend less. But let me burst your bubble right away: the likelihood of governments balancing their budgets by cutting spending is far smaller than them doing so by raising taxes.

This chapter reveals why we are trapped in a system built entirely on debt. Governments cannot cut their spending without triggering severe economic, social, and political consequences. Without an exponential increase in government spending, the welfare state, and any system like it, cannot survive.

**Mandatory spending: the elephant in the room**

For decades, population growth and rising productivity were the backbone of economic expansion. Now, however, economies and their governments have been blindsided by reality, facing unprecedentedly rapid aging and a shrinking workforce. This trend is inevitably leading to an explosion in mandatory government spending. The word 'mandatory' is crucial. It is simply impossible for governments to cut spending enough to halt the excessive accumulation of debt. But what exactly does mandatory government spending entail?

As a rule, this refers to all government expenditures that must be made regardless of who is in power or the prevailing economic conditions. These are expenditures embedded in the social fabric, established by permanent laws, and not subject to annual approval or rejection. These mandatory payments are often disbursed automatically. Examples include pension payments, healthcare allowances, and income subsidies.

The two most important categories of mandatory government spending are social security and healthcare. Social security includes pensions, disability schemes, unemployment benefits, and other forms of income support, such as welfare, child benefits, housing allowances, and food aid.

Healthcare spending covers a wide range of costs, including public health services, care for the elderly (such as Medicare in the United States), hospital and prescription drug subsidies, and health insurance allowances. In some countries and regions, including the European Union, this category also encompasses universal healthcare systems, which cover long-term care, elder care, and social health insurance schemes.

It doesn't take much imagination to see that in an aging society, mandatory spending on healthcare and social welfare is skyrocketing. A shrinking workforce is struggling to cover the costs for the growing number of retirees. This spending is already astronomical and will continue to soar in the coming decades. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), mandatory spending for the U.S. federal government—Washington, that is—amounted to \$4.1 trillion in the 2024 fiscal year. Total government spending during that period was \$6.8 trillion. This means mandatory spending accounts for 60% of all government expenditures. Consequently, without sweeping legislative changes, the U.S. government has little control over nearly two-thirds of its total budget.

![](media/image1.png){width="6.263888888888889in" height="3.9166666666666665in"}

That \$4.1 trillion is equivalent to about 14% of the American GDP. This is nearly four times the combined spending on defense, justice, education, and transportation. Per capita, mandatory government spending is \$12,000. For a family of four, this comes to almost \$50,000 a year—a quarter more than the median American household income.

However, the CBO's most critical figures are not found in its annual fiscal reports, but in *The Long-Term Budget Outlook*. This is a yearly analysis of the U.S. budget for the next thirty years. A key forecast is that mandatory spending, driven by healthcare, will climb from 14% to over 16% of GDP. Mandatory spending by the U.S. federal government is growing in both absolute and relative terms. This almost certainly means larger budget deficits and an even bigger mountain of debt. Moreover, these additional deficits are structural, as mandatory spending is fixed and cannot simply be changed. As a result, other discretionary spending comes under pressure.

**The cost of an aging population**

Healthcare systems, much like tax systems, are often complex and difficult to compare across countries. For instance, there are significant differences in how costs are split between the government and the public. Furthermore, the distinction between healthcare and social services is not always clear-cut. What one country classifies as healthcare spending, another might categorise as social services.

Most EU countries offer universal healthcare, giving nearly everyone access to medical care. These systems are largely financed through tax revenues and mandatory social security contributions. A key benefit of such a universal system is that it delivers medical care with relative efficiency, helping to keep overall costs down. This efficiency stems, for example, from governments negotiating directly with healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies, or capping costs through legislation. Of course, this centralisation of healthcare also means that governments bear the brunt of the costs.

The European Commission's triennial 'ageing report' confirms this. It is one of the commission's key strategic reports, featuring long-term projections for government spending on pensions, healthcare, and education in the EU up to 2070. Between 2014 and 2019, total EU spending on healthcare—by governments, businesses, and households combined—amounted to about 8.5% of GDP. This figure excludes the cost of long-term care, which the European Commission treats as a separate category. Hardly surprising, since the study focuses on the impact of an ageing population. After 2019, partly due to the Covid-19 pandemic, spending rose to well over 9% of GDP. In each of the years between 2014 and 2021, EU governments accounted for about 80% of healthcare expenditure. The cost of healthcare is gigantic, amounting to around €1.4 trillion in 2021. Given the system's design, EU governments foot most of the bill.

In China, the opposite is true. After the death of Mao Zedong (1976), the collectively organised healthcare system fell into decline. This system was symbolised by the so-called 'barefoot doctors', healthcare providers who, despite lacking full medical training, delivered low-cost healthcare on a massive scale to China's agricultural communes. In the 1960s and 1970s, 80% of the Chinese population lived in rural areas. Mao declared that healthcare should serve not only the cities but especially 'the peasants, workers, and soldiers'.

After the Maoist healthcare system collapsed in the 1980s, China did not begin rebuilding a public health system until the late 1990s. Today, it consists of a fragmented patchwork of national and urban programmes riddled with major inequalities. Although insurance coverage is now universal in China, out-of-pocket costs remain high. Chinese households pay almost a third of their total healthcare costs themselves, roughly three times as much as in Western economies.

When it comes to mandatory spending, a key factor is China’s active expansion of its public healthcare system. The five-year plan, the country’s main economic and social development blueprint, is channelling billions into improving healthcare coverage, efficiency, and accessibility. Meanwhile, China is ageing at a record pace. The number of people over 65 is set to double between 2020 and 2040, meaning that the peak in healthcare demand is still to come.

China’s healthcare system can be likened to an S-curve, where a slow start is followed by rapid growth that eventually levels off due to saturation. This growth path resembles the letter ‘S’. The combination of a more comprehensive healthcare system and an ageing population means China is on the cusp of an exponential rise in healthcare costs. The groundwork has been laid: nearly everyone is insured, and substantial investments have been made in healthcare infrastructure. The real surge will only begin once more elderly people start using the system. As soon as China hits the steep part of the S-curve, government spending will soar exponentially, and so will healthcare costs.

To put this into perspective: according to the World Health Organization (WHO), healthcare spending in China was \$672 per capita in 2022. By comparison, costs in Germany and the United States stood at \$6,182 and \$12,434 per capita, respectively. While it will take time for China’s healthcare costs to approach Germany’s, let alone those of the United States, the gap is so vast that even with high co-payments, this expense will place a heavy burden on the Chinese budget for decades to come.

The accompanying graph shows the trend in healthcare spending across the major economic blocs. With the exception of India, healthcare costs as a percentage of GDP are rising everywhere. This indicates that healthcare spending is growing faster than the economy, a trend reflected in public finances. This effect is further amplified by governments taking more centralized control of healthcare as their populations age.

![](media/image2.png){width="6.256944444444445in" height="3.9097222222222223in"}

Governments have little choice. The old-age dependency ratio is skyrocketing. A smaller workforce simply cannot support the growing elderly population, as they do not generate enough revenue from taxes and social security contributions. Governments must therefore choose: either cover the deficit with more debt or scale back healthcare. Even though healthcare is one of the largest mandatory expenses, it is highly unlikely that governments will reduce their deficits this way. On the contrary, estimates from the European Commission and the CBO indicate that healthcare costs will continue to rise.

**The endless costs of the welfare state**

While the United States takes the crown for healthcare spending, Europe is the undisputed leader of the expensive welfare state. Most eurozone countries have an extensive, government-funded patchwork of fixed contributions, subsidies, and benefits to guarantee a minimum standard of living. Social welfare is undoubtedly at the core of this system.

The European Union’s definition of 'social spending' reveals that these expenditures are far broader than just healthcare: 'Social protection benefits are transfers to households, in cash or in kind, intended to relieve them of the financial burden of a number of risks or needs. These include disability, sickness, old age, death of a breadwinner, family responsibilities, unemployment, housing and social exclusion.'

That is quite a mouthful, and a long list of expenses for which governments, once again, foot most of the bill. In 2023, EU governments spent €3,300 billion, or 19.2% of their GDP, on social welfare. That is almost two and a half times as much as total healthcare spending and a whopping 40% of the European Union's total government expenditure. Now that is what a welfare state looks like.

Although the 'old age' category is somewhat downplayed in the definition, it is by far the largest cost. Of the 19% of GDP spent on social welfare in 2023, more than half (10.4% of GDP) was directed to old age. Within this category, there is once again a clear 'winner' that accounts for the vast majority of these costs: pensions.

The dominance of the old age category within the overall cost structure of social welfare is unsurprising, yet troubling. While many people assume that the costs of an aging population are mainly reflected in healthcare spending, the link to welfare spending is far stronger. As our society ages at an accelerated pace in the coming decades, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to predict where this mandatory spending is headed. Nevertheless, few people truly grasp the immense burden that social welfare will place on government spending.

**The French cost wall**

To illustrate this point, let's look at France again. With total spending on social welfare exceeding 30% of its GDP and an extensive system of pensions, benefits, and healthcare, the country is one of Europe’s most developed welfare states. The graph shows that its current level of over 30% of GDP is already in a league of its own. Other countries have not yet reached such heights. Nevertheless, this percentage is set to rise in the coming decades to levels that will undoubtedly raise urgent questions about the sustainability of the French welfare state. All signs point to it becoming unaffordable.

![](media/image3.png){width="6.256944444444445in" height="3.9097222222222223in"}

Let me back this statement up with some figures. The premise is the link between an aging population and mandatory social security spending. Here, the median age in France serves as an indicator for its aging population. The median age is the point at which half the population is younger and the other half is older. In other words, it's the exact middle value when you line up the ages of all French residents from youngest to oldest. The median is less sensitive to outliers than the average. Suppose a country has ten inhabitants. Nine are 25 years old and one is 75. The median age is then 25. That's the age that splits the ordered list in half. The average age is 30, pulled up by that one 75-year-old resident, even though no one is actually that age.

The median age can be used to illustrate the relationship between population aging and the costs of social security. The graph on the next page shows the age of the French population on the horizontal axis and French government spending on social security as a percentage of GDP on the vertical axis. The series begins in 1980. To get the clearest possible picture, I'm using a three-year rolling average. So, that means the age and spending for the period 1980–1982, then 1981–1983, and so on.

The graph shows that the relationship between age and social security spending is positive. A higher age, on the right side of the horizontal axis, corresponds to higher government spending on social security. With a younger population, on the left side of the axis, spending is lower. The older the population, the greater the social security burden for the French government.

![](media/image4.png){width="6.256944444444445in" height="3.9097222222222223in"}

The graph also displays a formula: '1.4393 * x - 25.798'. This 'x' represents the median age. If you know the median age, you can use this formula to estimate government spending on social security. The R² or R-squared is also shown. This is an important statistic that indicates how strong the relationship between the two variables is, with a value between 0 and 1. If the R-squared is '0', there is no relationship at all between the variables, and if the R-squared is '1', the relationship is 'perfect'. In that case, knowing one variable allows you to calculate the other exactly using the formula. An R-squared of 0.84, as shown in the graph, means the relationship depicted is particularly strong. You can therefore estimate French government spending on social security quite accurately using the median age.

The stronger the relationship between two variables, the better you can use them to make predictions. If you know what the median age in France will be in ten years, you can accurately determine how high social spending will be. As we saw in Chapter 2, the United Nations provides reliable estimates for the median age. Each year, it conducts a comprehensive analysis of the future median age in various countries based on factors like birth and death rates, life expectancy, migration, and trends in health and population growth.

The United Nations expects the median age in France to be 43.4 years in a decade, an increase of 1.8 years from the current median. With this estimate, it's a simple matter of plugging in the numbers. The formula in the graph predicts that an increase in the median age to 43.4 years will cause French social spending to rise to 37% of GDP. This represents an increase of five percentage points over the current percentage.

The fiscal challenge facing France could well be even steeper. Instead of age, you can also use the old-age dependency ratio to explain social spending. After all, this ratio reflects how the working population, which has historically funded most social benefits, is shrinking, while the group that depends on those benefits, the elderly, is growing rapidly. If the old-age dependency ratio rises, it is safe to assume that social spending will follow suit.

In France, the relationship between the old-age dependency ratio and social spending is also strong, though slightly less pronounced than when using age as the explanatory variable (an R-squared of 0.7). Using the European Union’s projection for France’s old-age dependency ratio in ten years, the model predicts that social spending will climb to 43% of GDP. That would be an increase of eleven percentage points from the current level. Although this outcome is slightly less certain than the prediction based on age, it is nonetheless virtually guaranteed that French social spending will be much higher in ten years.

The reason I am going into such detail about these statistical relationships and spending estimates—not exactly riveting material—is that they vividly illustrate the challenges facing the governments of aging countries. Consider the projected increase in social spending in France from 32% to 37% of GDP due to its aging population. All else being equal, if the French government has to finance this increase with debt, the budget deficit will also rise by those five percentage points.

That may not sound shocking, but it certainly is. Let’s revisit the fiscal sustainability gap: the budget surplus countries must engineer to keep meeting all their obligations without letting public debt rise any further. The European commission’s figures in chapter 6 showed that the French gap is equivalent to 5.5% of gdp. If social security spending alone adds 5% to the budget deficit, that estimate is far too conservative. Of course, spending on social security does not exist in a vacuum. But that hardly paints a prettier picture. A quick glance at healthcare costs brings the uneasy realisation that the exponentially rising costs of an ageing population will ultimately be much higher than most economists and politicians are willing to consider.

This immediately explains the political paralysis in France. The decision to focus on France here is no coincidence. France is a textbook example of a rapidly ageing welfare state where the pressure on the government is so immense that it constantly leads to tension and instability. The only way to relieve the economic and political pressure is to let debts rise once more, which in turn casts even more doubt on its debt sustainability. If you’re still hoping that France’s budget deficit will meet the Maastricht treaty requirements in 2029, it’s high time to abandon that hope.

Finally, while France is a prime example of the welfare state’s unaffordability, we see a similar trend in many other large economies. Mandatory social security spending is consuming an ever-larger share of the economy and of government budgets. You can also look at it from another angle: an ageing population means households are growing increasingly dependent on government support. The working population cannot keep pace with this rise in costs, forcing governments to step in more and more. The American Economic Innovation Group has effectively illustrated this in its study, 'The Great Transfer-mation'. It shows that in a majority of local communities, over 25% of Americans’ personal income comes from government transfers. Fifty years ago, this was a rarity.

**Discretionary spending**

Bear with me; we have a few more figures to get through. They are essential for understanding that the debt-driven system cannot change unless we make difficult social choices. A prospect that policymakers generally prefer to avoid.

On paper, discretionary government spending is one area where policymakers do have room to direct the budget. This is spending that must be periodically approved by parliament or congress and, as such, is not classified as 'mandatory'. This includes spending on education, security, transport, culture, science and defence.

These are critical areas of public spending. It is therefore all the more striking that their share of total government expenditure is relatively small. The earlier CBO chart showed that in 2024, discretionary spending accounted for barely a quarter of total US government outlays ($1.8 trillion out of $6.8 trillion). In the EU, education, security, culture, and science collectively make up 15% of total government spending. The picture is no different in Japan, where mandatory spending on social services is rising faster than in any other major economy. Even if governments were to cut these items sharply, it would be insufficient to offset the escalating mandatory expenditures.

The words 'even if' are chosen deliberately here. I suspect that most readers, when looking at the list of discretionary spending categories, do not immediately think, 'Right, these are obvious areas where we can make significant cuts'. In practice, a large part of this spending is so woven into the fabric of our society that there is effectively no room to reduce it on a structural basis.

Take education, for example. In aging economies, characterised by a shrinking workforce, a solid education is crucial to prevent productivity—the last intrinsic source of growth—from also going under. Furthermore, inadequate education leads to greater inequality and is more likely to cause social unrest. When it comes to security, political choices are rarely truly voluntary anymore. With growing polarisation, there is an increasing need to allocate more resources to public order, cybersecurity and counter-terrorism.

Investment in transport and infrastructure is also often presented as 'discretionary', but economic reality paints a more nuanced picture. We are all familiar with the stories—which happen to be true—of how decades-long underinvestment in bridges, railways and road networks is hampering economic growth. Cutting spending on transport and infrastructure is hardly a straightforward option, given its direct link to economic growth. Especially not when you factor in the 'multiplier effect' of this spending category.

The multiplier effect indicates the extent to which a single euro or dollar of investment ultimately yields more than its initial value. For example, a local government commissions a bridge to connect two parts of a city. A construction company is awarded the contract, buys materials and machinery, and hires additional staff. These new employees spend their wages on their homes, groceries, a dinner out, or a nice holiday. The bridge allows people to get to work faster, reduces traffic congestion, and makes businesses more accessible. Moreover, the local government can decide to levy a toll on the bridge for extra revenue. In this way, a single investment triggers a chain of economic effects that collectively constitute the multiplier effect.

In China and India, they understand the infrastructure multiplier all too well. In many emerging economies, 'discretionary' spending on infrastructure often forms the backbone of economic growth. After all, in these countries, it is not a matter of connecting something or replacing a bridge, but of building bridges, railways, and roads for the very first time, which has a huge positive impact on economic growth. We have also seen countless examples in the recent past of China resorting to investments in industry and infrastructure during economic downturns. These investments are hardly discretionary and put more pressure on the budget, leading to rapid debt accumulation.

**The limit to good spending!**

Spending with a high multiplier seems like a no-brainer in a world with a structural lack of economic growth. However, in a world already awash with debt, even this is not a sure thing. The 'good debt' that Alexander Hamilton referred to simply no longer exists.

The CBO concluded in a 2021 report, with the ambitious title 'Effects of physical infrastructure spending on the economy and the budget under two illustrative scenarios', that infrastructure spending leads to more growth and tax revenues, provided it is not financed with additional debt. In their first scenario, the investments are funded by cuts elsewhere, resulting in higher productivity and a slightly declining budget deficit. But in the second scenario, where infrastructure spending is paid for through borrowing, debt and interest payments rise faster than the returns. The economic gain from the multiplier effect disappears due to the higher cost of debt and the reduced scope for private investment.

At a certain point, debt is so high that even the most worthwhile investment can no longer turn the balance sheet positive. At that point, even building bridges becomes pointless.

**Beyond discretionary**

I have yet to mention two major categories of discretionary government spending, for the simple reason that they are no longer discretionary, especially on my continent, Europe. These are climate and energy, and defence.

**Climate costs**

Climate is a 'hot topic', not least when it comes to government budgets. Nominally, climate investments and costs are discretionary, but in reality, they have become deeply intertwined with national and international regulations, climate laws, and treaties. Strikingly, governments—once again, particularly in Europe—pay little heed to uncertainty, even though it is a common consideration in economics and science. Climate change is presented as an established fact, with no margin for uncertainty, resulting in ever-increasing expenditure. In Europe, climate policy is more akin to a religion than a socio-economic issue.

Instead of balanced decision-making that considers other important issues, climate change is often given priority, even without a solid rationale. Any deviation from long-term goals, no matter how unrealistic, triggers an increase in climate spending to ‘course-correct’. Brussels takes this to an extreme. For the 2021--2027 period, the EU has earmarked over €578 billion, more than 30% of its budget, for climate-related spending. Various programmes are funding investments in green technologies, sustainable mobility, and energy-efficient buildings. Climate targets are embedded in all EU policy domains, making any deviation nearly impossible. If these targets are at risk, climate budgets are increased further, even when the shortfalls are not attributable to a lack of effort. According to the European Commission, at least €620 billion in additional green investments are needed annually until 2030 to meet the climate goals.

Naturally, the vast majority of this extra expenditure must be coughed up by governments. 'Fortunately', European budgetary rules provide exceptions for green investments, for which additional debt can be incurred. And so the circle is complete. In Europe, climate spending is anything but discretionary; it is skyrocketing and financed mainly by governments. Budgets must therefore be stretched, which predictably leads to a further rise in debt-to-GDP ratios. 'Rinse and repeat', as the Americans would say.

In other parts of the world, climate goals are approached less ideologically, which makes spending more discretionary. China is investing heavily in clean energy, but its motives are primarily economic. The European market for electric cars is now dominated by China. Energy is seen as a source of economic growth, so the more, the better. That is why China invests in both green and brown energy. This is the polar opposite of Europe, where nuclear power plants and gas fields were shut down despite a heavy reliance on Russian energy.

In the United States, climate spending depends heavily on who is in power. Under President Biden, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) rolled out a climate package of nearly $370 billion, focusing on tax breaks, subsidies, and investments in clean energy, electric vehicles, and grids. This approach relies partly on economic incentives: companies and households are financially rewarded for going green. This makes climate spending a discretionary tool. Should there be a political power shift, such as a re-election of Trump, these financial incentives and expenditures could be withdrawn or curtailed. In contrast to Europe, climate policy in the United States remains an instrument of fiscal policy.

**Defence -- from peace dividend to a de facto obligation**

Officially, defense spending is a discretionary budget item, meaning it requires periodic political approval. However, reclassifying it as mandatory spending wouldn't be out of place. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, defense is rapidly becoming a de facto mandatory expenditure. This is especially true in Europe, where defense was neglected for decades, and politicians are now lining up to make higher spending a permanent part of their budgets.

![](media/image5.png){width="6.256944444444445in" height="3.9097222222222223in"}

A structural increase in defense spending would mark a clear break with the past. After the cold war ended in the early nineties, defense expenditure plummeted. Policymakers and politicians wasted no time in cashing in on this 'peace dividend', redirecting the freed-up funds to commitments like healthcare and social services. In doing so, they conveniently kicked the can down the road on difficult questions about the long-term sustainability of those programs.

Even Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, which in hindsight was a clear warning sign, failed to make defense a priority for policymakers. At the 2014 NATO summit in Wales, member states solemnly declared that a united, free, and peaceful Europe had been fundamentally undermined. In response, they pledged to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense. It was an empty promise: little of that spending ever materialized. Germany spent barely 1% of its GDP on defense in 2014, a figure that remained unchanged for the next five years. By 2023, Germany was still half a percentage point short of the target it had committed to a decade earlier.

Unfortunately, it often seems to take a major crisis these days to break the status quo. Over time, politicians have become increasingly reactive, a hardly positive trait. For Europe, it took a war on its own continent and an angry man in Washington to be spurred into action. During his election campaigns, US president Trump repeatedly stated that he viewed the NATO target of 2% of GDP for defense spending as a bare minimum. In 2023, the United States spent over 3% of its GDP on defense. Then, in early 2024, he declared in a campaign speech that he would not defend NATO allies who failed to meet their spending commitments in the event of a Russian attack.

A year later, at the annual Munich Security Conference, his vice president, JD Vance, came down hard on Europe. He argued, among other things, that European countries invest too little in their own security and are too dependent on the United States. He stressed that most European countries lack armies capable of adequately defending their own territory. Vance’s speech is well worth watching. The look of discomfort and indignation on the faces in the audience as Vance railed against Europe’s failed policies speaks volumes.

Incidentally, Trump’s remark about defending a NATO country that underspends on defence was contrary to the alliance's core tenet: article 5. An attack on one member state is considered an attack on all member states. Nevertheless, a growing number of European politicians, fuelled by the protracted conflict in Ukraine and the shift in American foreign policy, realise that defence spending needs to be ramped up significantly. This is why the EU has launched 'Readiness 2030'. Originally, EU President Von der Leyen had, seemingly single-handedly, dubbed the plan 'ReArm Europe'. Several member states, however, found that a bit over the top. The focus should be on the EU's preparedness and strategic autonomy, rather than on mobilising weapons.

To achieve this, 'Readiness 2030' calls for €800 billion in defence spending over four years. That amounts to roughly 5% of the EU’s GDP. A substantial sum. Where will the money come from? You’ve probably guessed it: borrowing. Of the €800 billion, €650 billion will come from extra borrowing capacity for member states, made possible by relaxing EU budget rules. The remaining €150 billion will consist of loans guaranteed by the EU budget for air defence, artillery, drones, cyber capabilities, and logistics, among other things. This touches upon an extremely sensitive political issue: so-called Eurobonds, jointly issued bonds by EU or eurozone countries for which they are collectively liable. Will Germany and the Netherlands—two countries that have managed to keep their debt in check—risk their creditworthiness for the sake of the Eurozone?

The pattern is obvious. All extra spending, such as on defence, is financed by debt and requires loosening budget rules, with a predictable outcome: ever more debt. This is exactly how a debt-driven economy works. While Europe may currently be the epicentre of this drive for higher defence spending, the rest of the world is unlikely to lag far behind. Geopolitical tensions are mounting: the relationship between the United States and China is deteriorating, sparking further unrest around Taiwan. Russia remains a risk, and it is difficult to imagine what an end to the conflicts in the Middle East might look like.

This begs the question of whether we are heading for a new version of the ‘guns or butter’ model. Forced by sky-high debts and budgets bursting at the seams, governments must, in principle, choose between defence, security, and weapons (‘guns’) on the one hand, and education, infrastructure, and healthcare (‘butter’) on the other. But because this choice is seen as an impossible task, many policymakers invariably resort to the path of more debt. Especially at a time of rising geopolitical tensions and increasing polarisation. Making no choice is also a choice: one that leads to even more debt.

**The interest burden**

Where there’s debt, there’s interest. As a rule, borrowing money isn't free. Against a backdrop of high tax rates, rising mandatory spending, lax fiscal discipline, and relentless debt accumulation, interest expenses become a critical factor for overall stability.

Interest expenses are often classified as a separate spending category, but this doesn't change the fact that they are undeniably mandatory. Businesses and households that don't pay their interest go bankrupt. Governments that fail to meet their interest obligations will no longer find anyone willing to lend them money. Listing interest expenses as a separate category makes it clear how much of a burden the cost of debt places on the budget and the economy. And as we will see, these costs underpin 'The Great Rebalancing' of investment portfolios worldwide.

**An explosion of costs**

Back to The Long-Term Budget Outlook from the CBO. The forecasts in this publication are used by many institutions and research firms for further analysis, including the prominent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. In a series of blog posts, the committee points out that US interest expenses 'are set to explode'. By 2025, the US government's interest expenses are estimated to reach a record 3.2% of GDP. That amounts to over a trillion dollars—more than the entire GDP of the Netherlands, Turkey, or Switzerland. In 2025, the US government will spend more on paying interest than on defence.

![](media/image6.png){width="6.256944444444445in" height="3.9097222222222223in"}

After 2025, interest costs are set to rise to 5.4% of GDP over thirty years. This equates to an additional annual budget deficit of 2.2% of GDP, assuming all else remains equal. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget predicts that by 2045, the average interest rate on US government debt will outpace GDP growth. In other words, from that year onwards, Domar's formula of r > g (interest rate higher than growth) will apply, rendering US debt unsustainable. The committee puts it this way: 'The average interest rate on debt will exceed the economic growth rate by 2045, sparking the beginning of a debt spiral.' A debt spiral. This does not bode well, especially given that the CBO’s growth forecasts already seem quite optimistic.

In Japan and most eurozone countries, interest costs as a percentage of GDP are considerably lower than in the United States. However, this does not mean these countries are in a better position. In 2025, France's interest payments will be about 2% of its GDP, a figure that is set to rise in the coming years. Considering that France's potential GDP growth is barely 1% and is also declining, those seemingly low interest costs look far less comfortable. For Italy, which would have reverted to the lira almost fifteen years ago without the ECB's exceptional policies, interest payments amount to just under 4% of GDP. This is set against potential economic growth that is even lower than France's. With the Italian government's debt-to-GDP ratio at 135%, it is clear that its mountain of debt is not sustainable without continued assistance.

In Japan, interest payments amount to less than 1% of GDP. In the years following the COVID crisis, this figure was almost zero, thanks to the Japanese central bank's extraordinary policy. Is it a coincidence that one of the world's oldest economies, with a shrinking population, almost no growth potential, and by far the largest mountain of debt, pays the least in interest?

Finally, let us return to the United States. The figure on the left-hand page clearly shows that net interest expenses are claiming an increasingly dominant share of US government spending, leading to an ever-larger budget deficit. By 2055, an estimated 20% of government spending will go towards interest payments. The US government will then have to spend one out of every five dollars on (re)financing its debt. These interest payments are so large that they alone will drive up the national debt, resulting in even higher interest costs. This is the debt spiral countries find themselves in when their economic growth is no longer sufficient to keep their debts in check.

**A grim tally**

Taken together, the last three chapters make it painfully clear that governments worldwide are facing an uphill battle. Ageing populations, eroded tax bases, exploding healthcare and social security costs, new mandatory spending commitments, and soaring interest burdens are putting governments with their backs against the wall.

The notion that budgets can be put in order with the right discipline is hopelessly outdated. To prevent debt from spiralling further, governments would have to enforce massive primary budget surpluses year after year. Only drastic measures that would severely impact living standards and unleash a wave of social and political unrest could accomplish this on paper.

What remains is a spiral of rising deficits, mounting debt, and escalating interest payments. So, is there anything that can break this spiral? Breaking it completely is probably too much to ask, but the last chart clearly illustrates the key to prolonging debt sustainability for as long as possible.
