# Chapter 11: **The Rise of the Petrodollar**

After the default of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, the world found itself in a situation that it had never been in before: The money that practically everybody used globally was completely unbacked by anything scarce. There had been periods in the past where fiat currencies were attempted and eventually hyperinflated, but only on national and regional scales. This post-Bretton Woods system was the first time that a purely fiat currency was attempted worldwide.

A sovereign government can be rather effective at forcing the usage of its currency domestically. By making taxes payable only in their currency, by adding capital gains taxes to commodity monies, by enforcing legal tender laws that require all merchants to accept that currency as payment, and through various bank regulations that attempt to slow down the supply growth of their currency, they can often maintain a sufficient degree of demand for the currency relative to the available supply. However, a government has little or no way to force other countries to accept their currency. Their currency is nothing more than pieces of paper, or a bank ledger, which are not backed by anything and for which the rules can be unilaterally changed. Fiat currency offers no utility to any end user, nor is it redeemable for anything else that offers utility.

The United States and other countries experienced major inflation in the 1970s. The supply of dollars, pounds, francs, and other currencies continued to expand, and were not backed by or redeemable for anything. Meanwhile, U.S. conventional oil production peaked in 1970 after a century of nearly continuous growth, and domestic production began to roll over for many years, which made the country more reliant on oil imports. In 1973, Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing nations in the Middle East embargoed oil for nations that supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War, including the United States. This caused an oil supply shock and associated oil price shock during a time of sharply rising demand.

However, the United States was unique in terms of how large and powerful it was, both militarily and economically. If there was any country who could force or entice other countries to accept their unbacked currency as real payment, it would be them. Andrea Wong's 2016 long-form article for *Bloomberg*, "The Untold Story Behind Saudi Arabia's 41-Year U.S. Debt Secret" described in detail how the United States convinced Saudi Arabia and other nations in the region to accept dollars for payment and to hold dollars in the form of U.S. Treasury securities as long-term savings.

In 1974, President Nixon's new U.S. Treasury Secretary William Simon flew to Europe and the Middle East for a diplomacy trip. Out of all people, why would the United States send its Treasury secretary for such a mission? The answer was that it was mainly a trip regarding financial diplomacy, centered around U.S. Treasury securities. From Wong's article:

> Officially, Simon's two-week trip was billed as a tour of economic diplomacy across Europe and the Middle East, full of the customary meet-and-greets and evening banquets. But the real mission, kept in strict confidence within President Richard Nixon's inner circle, would take place during a four-day layover in the coastal city of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
>
> The goal: neutralize crude oil as an economic weapon and find a way to persuade a hostile kingdom to finance America's widening deficit with its newfound petrodollar wealth. And according to Parsky, Nixon made clear there was simply no coming back empty-handed. Failure would not only jeopardize America's financial health but could also give the Soviet Union an opening to make further inroads into the Arab world.[^166]

The deal that Simon reached on behalf of the Nixon Administration with Saudi leadership was as follows. The United States would buy a lot of oil from Saudi Arabia and sell a lot of military equipment and aid to them in return. The United States would, by extension, also use its unrivaled naval power to ensure that the Strait of Hormuz (a narrow portion of the Persian Gulf between Saudi Arabia and their adversary Iran) would remain open for global oil trade, since that is how the U.S. would get its oil as well. Saudi Arabia would take their dollar trade surpluses, which were referred to as "petrodollars," and invest them primarily into U.S. Treasury securities to finance U.S. federal deficit spending. In addition, Saudi Arabia would only sell their oil to other countries in dollars, which would reinforce global demand for dollars and reinforce the dollar's status as the world's international medium of exchange and store of value.

A final condition on the deal was that Saudi Arabia wanted to keep the deal secret. Treasuries were to be sold to Saudi Arabia mostly off the record, outside of the normal auction process. Wong continued:

> It took several discreet follow-up meetings to iron out all the details, Parsky said. But at the end of months of negotiations, there remained one small, yet crucial, catch: King Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud demanded the country's Treasury purchases stay "strictly secret," according to a diplomatic cable obtained by Bloomberg from the National Archives database.

For her article, Wong used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain previously non-public information on the arrangement. Prior to this article, the financial relationship between Saudi Arabia and the United States was a "known secret," and this reporting by mainstream media gave it additional transparency and weight. Due to the United States' support of Israel, the United States was viewed very negatively by many Muslim-majority countries in the 1970s, and so Saudi Arabia wanted to keep the relationship a secret. Saudi Arabia's leadership worried about the negative optics of associating closely with the United States. However, they also wanted to strengthen their economic and military security against their nearby rival Iran, which is why the petrodollar deal was compelling to them.

The summary of this period of history was that the United States had enough military and economic prowess to convince Saudi Arabia and other nations to keep using its centralized and unbacked fiat currency ledger. The global oil market is enormous, and by convincing many producers to price it in dollars, sell it in dollars, and to hold their petrodollar surpluses in U.S. Treasuries, the United States basically backed the dollar by oil. The dollar was not redeemable or pegged to any specific amount of oil, but this new system made it so that any oil-importing country should want to hold dollars (often in the form of U.S. Treasuries) as reserves, to ensure that they could buy oil when needed. This kept global demand for dollars going strong, and therefore kept the overall dollar network effect going strong. Starting in 1974 and continuing to the present, the world has mostly operated on this petrodollar standard.[^167] I refer to this system as the Eurodollar/Petrodollar system because it's a combination of natural network effects from being the world's largest economy in an era where transactions occur far faster than settlements, and from intentional design choices by that dominant country to encourage producers of scarce resources to use that ledger and reinforce those network effects.

And for the United States' role, they had to maintain somewhat credible institutions and a high degree of division of powers between their central bank and their government so that the dollar would be viewed as a credible currency on a global scale. In 1978 and 1979, after a decade of runaway inflation, the United States financial reputation was bad enough that they issued some of their government debt in Swiss francs and West German marks to build up foreign exchange reserves --- almost like a developing country generally must do.[^168] Starting in 1979 and continuing into the 1980s, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker raised interest rates to nearly 20% and put the United States into a recession to stabilize the dollar. Both Jimmy Carter and his successor Ronald Reagan supported him in this hawkish action.

At the time, countries in Latin America in aggregate had rather high dollar-denominated debt. By hardening the dollar with very high inflation-adjusted interest rates, the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Paul Volcker crushed many of their businesses and government finances, and thus reduced their purchasing power for oil consumption. The United States was able to continue receiving oil from Saudi Arabia at low prices, while Latin American oil consumption stagnated due to the value of their currencies being crushed. During the 1980s as shown in Figure 11-A, the world temporarily stopped increasing its oil consumption, mainly because developed countries continued to increase oil consumption while many developing countries (especially in Latin America) had to reduce theirs.[^169]

In 1999, Saddam Hussein of Iraq (which at the time had the second-largest oil reserves) began selling oil in the newly created euro. Russia, Venezuela, and Iran were also dabbling in non-dollar oil sales around the same time. After the multilateral invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the United States performed a unilateral invasion of Iraq in 2003, with very little support from the global community other than the United Kingdom.

To this day, there has never been a satisfactory explanation for why the United States invaded Iraq. The public reason at the time was focused on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, which were never found and were never there. There is no shortage of dictators in the world, including some that do have weapons of mass destruction such as North Korea. Why did the United States invade Iraq in particular? Among the 19 terrorists that were directly involved in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, 15 of them were Saudi Arabian and none of them were Iraqi. The masterminds of the attack, meanwhile, were in Afghanistan near the border of Pakistan.

Shortly after the United States' invasion of Iraq, Iraq went back to selling oil in dollars. The idea that the United States invaded them due to their sale of oil for euros is often labeled a conspiracy theory; it probably wasn't the only reason, but the United States does have a very aggressive track record with countries that sell significant amounts of oil outside of the dollar-based system, with this being the most high-profile example. Ron Paul, who was a sitting U.S. congressman at the time, gave a 2006 speech to Congress on this topic and therefore put it on the public record. The following is a key excerpt from Paul's speech:

> It is now common knowledge that the immediate reaction of the administration after 9/11 revolved around how they could connect Saddam Hussein to the attacks to justify an invasion and overthrow of his government. Even with no evidence of any connection to 9/11 or evidence of weapons of mass destruction, public and congressional support was generated through distortions and flat-out misrepresentations of the facts to justify overthrowing Saddam Hussein.
>
> There was no public talk of removing Saddam Hussein because of his attack on the integrity of the dollar as a reserve currency by selling his oil in euros, yet many believe this was the reason for our obsession with Iraq. I doubt it was the only reason, but it may well have played a significant role in our motivation to wage war. Within a very short period after the military victory in Iraq, all Iraqi oil sales were carried out in dollars. The euro was immediately abandoned.
>
> In 2001, Venezuela's ambassador to Russia spoke of Venezuela's switching to the euro for all their oil sales. Within a year, there was a coup attempt against Chavez, reportedly with assistance from our CIA. After these attempts to nudge the euro toward replacing the dollar as the world's reserve currency were met with resistance, the sharp fall of the dollar against the euro was reversed. These events may well have played a significant role in maintaining dollar dominance.
>
> It has become clear the U.S. administration was sympathetic to those who plotted the overthrow of Chavez and was embarrassed by its failure. The fact that Chavez was democratically elected had little influence on which side we supported. Now a new attempt is being made against the petrodollar system. Iran, another member of the 'Axis of Evil,' has announced her plans to initiate an oil bourse in March of this year. Guess what? The oil sales will be priced in euros, not dollars.
>
> Most Americans forgot how our policies have systematically and needlessly antagonized the Iranians over the years. In 1953, the CIA helped overthrow a democratically elected Mohammed Mossadegh and installed the authoritarian Shah, who was friendly to the U.S. The Iranians were still fuming over this when the hostages were seized in 1979. Our alliance with Saddam Hussein in his invasion of Iran in the early 1980s did not help matters and obviously did not do much for our relationship with Saddam Hussein. The administration's announcement in 2001 that Iran was part of the Axis of Evil did not improve the diplomatic relationship between our two countries. Recent threats over nuclear power, while ignoring the fact that they are surrounded by countries with nuclear weapons, does not seem to register with those who continue to provoke Iran. With what most Muslims perceive as our war against Islam and this recent history, there is little wonder why Iran might choose to harm America by undermining the dollar. Iran, like Iraq, has zero capability to attack us, but that did not stop us from turning Saddam Hussein into a modern-day Hitler ready to take over the world. Now Iran, especially since she has made plans for pricing oil in euros, has been on the receiving end of a propaganda war not unlike that waged against Iraq before our invasion.
>
> It is not likely that maintaining dollar supremacy was the only motivating factor for the war against Iraq nor for agitating against Iran. Though the real reasons for going to war are complex, we now know the reasons given before the war started, like the presence of weapons of mass destruction and Saddam\'s connection to 9/11, were false.[^171]

In a world of competing sovereign ledgers, each of which are unbacked and centralized, we can once again return to this book's thematic question, "Who controls the ledger?" The answer, geopolitically, is that in the telecommunication age, whichever country has the most economic and military prowess is likely to have the primary control over the world's ledger, unless or until there is a better solution, or until no single nation is large enough to force its will onto the rest of the world. The mightiest country's ledger serves as the independent third-party unit of account for international transactions. South Korea and Saudi Arabia, for example, don't have to trust each other's ledgers if they want to trade with each other, but they do both need to trust the United States. Among fiat currencies, the world reserve currency is the most salable for international trade by far.

As of this writing, there are approximately 160 fiat currencies in the world, and most of them are not very salable or desired outside of their own monopoly jurisdictions. Money is supposed to avoid the need for barter, but when there are 160 different government-issued monies, it ironically ends up replicating a barter system --- at least when it comes to global trade. Therefore, a primary settlement asset and unit of account is important so that nations who don't trust each other's arbitrary fiat currencies can still trade with each other. Prior to 1944, this settlement asset and unit of account was gold. During the Bretton Woods era from 1944 to 1971, gold was still used, while U.S. dollars (being redeemable for gold and representing the full faith and credit of the world's largest economic and military power) were used as well. From the mid-1970s to the present day, the U.S. dollar has represented the primary unit of account and payment rail for international trade, with U.S. dollar deposits and U.S. Treasury securities also representing the primary savings asset for foreign reserve holdings.

The United States maintains its fiat ledger, and other sovereign nations attach themselves to the United States' ledger by holding a considerable amount of dollars, either in the form of U.S. bank deposits or U.S. Treasury securities. If their currencies weaken too much, the central banks of those countries can sell some of their dollars and buy back some of their currency, thereby tightening and strengthening it. On the other hand, if a country runs considerable trade surpluses and their currency strengthens, they can print more of their currency, expand their ledger, and buy more dollar assets to weaken the individual unit value of their currency and increase their dollar reserves. To a lesser extent, countries also hold units of other major countries' currencies for a bit of diversification, and many countries also still hold considerable amounts of gold.

Putting this together, the world basically operates on a two-tier financial system. Most people on the bottom tier are stuck paying and saving in whatever their local currency is, and out of 160 currencies, most are not very good. Especially in developing countries, individual people often find it very hard to save money, as their currencies are constantly devalued and occasionally hyperinflated. On the second tier, meanwhile, the export companies, import companies, wealthy class, and central banks of these countries use dollars and other major currencies to interact with global markets. The leaders of these countries, who frequently devalue the savings of their people, often maintain dollar-denominated or franc-denominated or euro-denominated accounts for themselves in offshore banks and tax havens rather than subject themselves to the ongoing currency weakness that their own people routinely experience.

**A History of Monetary Transitions**

This chapter finishes with a set of simplified diagrams to summarize the monetary transitions that have occurred since the dawn of the telecommunication age, as described over these past three chapters.

From the 1870s until World War I, the international gold standard looked like Figure 11-B. Each major country that participated in the system pegged its own currency to a fixed amount of gold and held a fluctuating amount of gold in reserve, for which it was redeemable to its citizens and foreign creditors.

Figure 11-B

The Bretton Woods system from the 1940s until 1971, shown in Figure 11-C, involved the dollar being backed by gold, but only redeemable to foreign creditors in limited amounts. Foreign currencies pegged themselves to the dollar and held dollars/Treasuries and gold in reserve.

Figure 11‑C

The Petrodollar system from the 1970s to the present, shown in Figure 11-D, made it so that practically only dollars could buy oil imports around the world, and so countries globally hold a combination of dollars, gold, and other major currencies as reserves, with an emphasis on dollars. As their network effect became entrenched over time after years of the Bretton Woods system and the Petrodollar system being in place, dollars became the primary global unit of account for international trade and finance more broadly. Under this system of floating exchange rates, if countries want to strengthen their currencies, they can sell some reserves and buy back their own currency. If countries want to weaken their currencies, they can print more of their currency and buy more reserve assets.
