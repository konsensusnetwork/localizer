# Chapter 10: **The Bretton Woods System**

After World War I, several countries including Germany and Russia experienced outright hyperinflation. Some countries that came out of the war in better shape such as the United Kingdom, on the other hand, merely experienced very high inflation, and attempted to re-peg their currencies to gold.

The British leadership, being the issuer of the world reserve currency at the time, took great pride in the historic soundness of their money that they had recently debased quite severely. They attempted to re-peg their currency to gold in 1925 at the pre-war rate, even though there was much more currency in the system relative to gold at that point compared to pre-war levels. Even sound money advocates at the time, such as Ludwig von Mises, criticized this attempt as being nonsensical. The inflationary damage was already done; the currency needed to be re-pegged at a realistic lower rate.[^146]

The 1920s decade after the first World War saw persistently higher unemployment in the United Kingdom than they had in the years and decades prior to the war. This was due to many factors, including a brief post-war depression period, but creating an artificially strong currency due to a currency-to-gold peg at a nonsensical level contributed to it. Due to severe inflation in the money supply and prices, wages had gone up significantly in the United Kingdom in terms of pound sterling compared to the decade prior, and yet they were still attempting to peg the pound to gold at the pre-war exchange rate. In other words, the average worker would supposedly earn much more gold per hour worked than they did prior to the war. This artificially made wages far higher than they really were on an actual economic basis, which rendered the United Kingdom uncompetitive in the global marketplace.[^147] It wasn't that a strong currency was a problem, but rather, it was that an *artificially* strong currency was a problem. Furthermore, it would be hard for the Bank of England to maintain enough gold reserves to honor redemptions with a peg at the pre-war rate, since their gold reserves did not grow in line with how much the money supply had grown.

This artificial top-down enforcement of monetary value by the United Kingdom and several countries contributed to excessive capital flows and bubbles globally throughout the decade, which ultimately contributed to the 1929 credit and speculation bubble in the United States. This was followed by the subsequent crash and the 1930s Great Depression. Then, during the 1930s, many governments gave up on their gold standards, and either eliminated the possibility for currency redemption for gold altogether or re-priced their gold pegs at much weaker currency rates.

During the 1920s in the United States, debt built up to a very large degree relative to the money supply. Total debt in the system was \$173 billion in 1929, while the monetary base was a little over \$6 billion --- and the monetary base itself was only partially backed by gold.[^148] As a result, there was roughly a 28-to-1 ratio in the amount of dollars promised to be paid to people in the future relative to the amount of dollars that existed, and even higher in terms of gold, which dollars were redeemable for. This was unsustainable, and when the economy eventually ran out of steam from such a leveraged state, it was fated toward catastrophe.

During the early 1930s, fractional reserve banks failed across the United States, and therefore the broad money supply shrank severely. Many depositors were wiped out, many creditors were wiped out, and people lost their jobs. The Dust Bowl (caused by a combination of natural drought and improper farming techniques, partially fueled by farmer financing strategies at the time) further exacerbated the real poverty that people experienced during the 1930s. As banks failed and many peoples' deposits were outright defaulted on, more and more depositors stood in line at banks to withdraw their cash, preferring to hold it under their mattress rather than keeping it in a bank.[^149] This further exacerbated the insolvency and illiquidity of the banking system, which was inherently unstable due to how many claims there were for base dollars compared to actual base dollars. The centralized ledger of the United States and its financial system was spiraling downward toward complete failure.[^150]

In 1933, the United States federal government proclaimed a bank holiday, where banks were shut down for many days, and subsequently re-opened gradually with better capitalization to encourage people to put their deposits back in. In a paper published in 2009 for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York called "Why Did FDR's Bank Holiday Succeed?," William Silber described that, "The President used the emergency currency provisions of the Act to encourage the Federal Reserve to create de facto 100 percent deposit insurance in the reopened banks."[^151]

This de facto deposit insurance was only possible due to the government and central bank's ability to create more base dollars out of thin air, but their ability to create base dollars didn't extend to creating more gold which those base dollars were redeemable for. Therefore, as dollars were printed and banks were recapitalized, dollars would become increasingly unbacked by actual gold. The central bank's gold vaults would be depleted if this was allowed to continue.

This was in large part due to the inherent gap in speed between banking ledgers and gold. That speed gap became arbitraged over time such that there were far, *far* more IOUs for gold-backed dollars moving around the economy than there was actual gold --- until a pin came along and popped that fragile bubble. If gold could inherently move and be authenticated faster, then there would be less of a reason to use IOUs for it. The various IOUs that did exist would be tested (redeemed) more often, which would prevent such a huge imbalance in supply from building up over time. But alas, gold doesn't move as fast as telecommunication-enhanced ledgers do, and so the mismatch remained unaddressed for long stretches of time until it became outrageously imbalanced.

Soon after the bank holiday in 1933, the United States federal government put forth an executive order saying that all citizens must turn in their gold for payment in dollars at the prevailing redemption rate. It became illegal to own meaningful amounts of gold, punishable by up to a decade in prison. It was even illegal for Americans to own gold overseas. In other words, the U.S. federal government's centrally controlled, leveraged ledger was in such dire conditions that they had to outlaw the ownership of a benign yellow metal under the threat of imprisonment and violence. They also shifted ownership of gold reserves from the Federal Reserve to the U.S. Treasury.

Once they collected a significant amount of gold, the U.S. federal government passed the 1934 Gold Reserve Act. This redefined the dollar from about 1/20th of an ounce of gold to 1/35th an ounce of gold. In other words, they devalued the dollar significantly relative to gold after they got much of the gold in their possession. This amounted to a default toward the public; the dollars that the public had been holding, which had been promised for a long time to be redeemable for gold on an exchange rate of \$20.67 for an ounce of gold, were now officially set at \$35 per ounce of gold and were no longer redeemable to them even at that rate.[^152] Currency devaluation favors debtors over creditors, and there was no bigger debtor than the U.S. federal government.

With this huge uptick in gold collection by the government, and the devaluation of the dollar relative to gold, the government effectively increased the amount of gold backing that it had for its currency. Although they had ended the convertibility of gold toward the public, the U.S. government still maintained redemption of the dollar for gold by foreign creditors, to maintain international credibility of this newly refreshed centralized ledger system. From 1933 until 1971, the United States operated on a marginal gold standard, where the currency was still technically pegged to gold (at a lower rate), but with no way for American citizens to enforce that peg.

Throughout the 1930s decade, during a period of global economic stagnation, political populism grew around the world. Many remnants of World War I, which had not been fully dealt with, bubbled back up to the surface. Currencies had failed, savings had disappeared, the working class had revolted against the wealthy class to varying degrees across nations, and people in previously defeated nations had turned toward political extremism. Large portions of the public wanted "strong men" to lead them and tell them who was causing their problems, even if it meant a reduction in individual liberty and laying false blame on minority groups. These issues, along with many other factors that are far too long to list here, eventually led to World War II.

During World War II, governments around the world once again printed vast sums of new money to drain their citizens' savings and finance their war efforts, which led to major currency devaluations and persistent price inflation. And governments once again enacted price and wage controls to try to curtail the inflation that they themselves caused with their money-printing. They also enacted various policies to direct private sector production toward the war effort.[^153] Multiple currencies outright hyperinflated, while the currencies of the winning nations devalued by half or more.

As the war began to wind down in 1944, with the Allied Forces moving toward a clear victory, representatives of 44 countries met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to discuss how the post-war monetary system should be constructed.

**Two Competing Visions**

A global monetary order is, at its core, a description of how trade will be settled between countries who don't necessarily trust each other's public ledger. To the extent that technology allows them to, governments can enforce the usage of their own centralized ledger systems on people in their country, but they can't really force other countries to accept the validity of those systems.

Historically, precious metals tended to be internationally accepted money, being used as nature's ledger that no country could substantially manipulate. However, in the era of globally interconnected bank ledgers, a powerful empire such as the United Kingdom in the 19th century or the United States in the 20th century can determine the global monetary order for a period of time and put their ledger system at or near the heart of it.

During the 1944 Bretton Woods conference, there were two primary visions for how the global monetary system should be built. The first was from John Maynard Keynes of the United Kingdom, and the second was from Harry Dexter White of the United States.

John Maynard Keynes proposed a neutral settlement system, with a supranational currency unit of account called a "bancor" at the center. A bancor would essentially represent a proportional basket of major global currencies, and while gold could be redeemed for bancors, bancors would not be redeemable for gold. In his book, *The Battle of Bretton Woods*, Benn Steil described the bancor as the following:

> Each item a member country exported would add bancors to its ICB account, and each item it imported would subtract bancors. Limits would be imposed on the amount of bancor a country could accumulate by selling more abroad than it bought, and on the amount of bancor debt it could rack up by buying more than it sold. This was to stop countries building up excessive surpluses or deficits. Each country\'s limits would be proportional to its share of world trade. This method of establishing bancor quotas was, not incidentally, convivial to British interests, as Britain had little gold but needed to conduct lots of trade.
>
> Once initial limits had been breached, deficit countries would be allowed to depreciate, and surplus countries to appreciate their currencies. This would make deficit country goods cheaper, and surplus country goods more expensive, with the aim of stimulating a rebalancing of trade. Further bancor debit or credit position breaches would trigger mandatory action. For chronic debtors, this would include obligatory currency depreciation, rising interest payments to the ICB Reserve Fund, forced gold sales, and capital export restrictions. For chronic creditors, it would include currency appreciation and payment of a minimum of 5 percent interest on excess credits, rising to 10 percent on larger excess credits, to the ICB\'s Reserve Fund.[^154]

The advantage of Keynes' proposal was that it would in many ways replicate the gold standard from a global settlement perspective: Like gold, the bancor was a neutral settlement asset, but operated at higher speed and with some supply flexibility. Trade imbalances between countries would inevitably correct themselves over time. The disadvantage of Keynes' proposal was that it was a centralized and tightly managed system built around a depreciating asset that required a lot of seamless coordination between many countries to work properly, and therefore would be geopolitically fragile.

Harry Dexter White, on the other hand, proposed that all participating governments should peg their currencies to the United States dollar, and that the dollar would remain pegged to gold at a fixed exchange rate, and redeemable for gold to foreign central banks. Foreign central banks should therefore hold dollars (mainly in the form of U.S. Treasury bonds), since they were supposedly as good as gold and earned some interest. Along with this proposal, White helped to engineer the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which would serve as the enticements, guardrails, and enforcers of this system.

At the time of this proposal, the United States had a tremendous amount of geopolitical leverage to get what it wanted. Unlike the rest of the world, the United States' homeland was nearly untouched by the ravages of the war. Many other countries had experienced massive devastation to their industrial production capabilities, including those on the winning side who merely achieved a Pyrrhic victory. In addition, the United States had the world's largest economy that represented over 40% of global GDP on its own, the world's best geography (two massive oceans, two friendly borders, the world's most extensive inland river system, and plenty of oil deposits), along with vast amounts of gold. Aside from owning large amounts of its own gold, many allied countries had sent their gold to the United States for custodial safekeeping as well, in case they were overrun by their enemies during the war. Acceptance of the Bretton Woods system was also part of the Marshall Plan, meaning that if war-torn countries wanted financial assistance from the United States to rebuild after the war, they needed to accept the vision of the United States for how the global order should be structured in terms of money and trade.[^155]

Ultimately, White's proposal won out, and when it was finalized after the war in 1946, it represented a switchover from the United Kingdom to the United States being the issuer of the world reserve currency.[^156] Unfortunately, however, the system's design was flawed from the start, and these flaws quickly manifested themselves once the system went into full operation after 1958, when exchange controls on current account transactions were eliminated.[^157]

**Eurodollars and the Bretton Woods Default**

In a free banking system, where individual banks rather than the government issue gold-backed currency, the amount of currency in the system is at least somewhat constrained by the amount of gold in the system. This is because individual banks only have so much gold reserves and need to maintain adequate backing to meet customer redemptions. Banks that fail to do this will eventually experience a bank run and be put out of business. Therefore, while the amount of currency in the system can fluctuate relative to gold, it quickly encounters problems and contracts whenever the disconnect becomes too wide, since there is no central entity that can instantly create more gold and bail out the system. Individual free banks can, if allowed by regulators, manage their risk by branching and by using careful lending policies, but they are always subject to tests on their liquidity and solvency due to the prospect for bank runs.[^158]

However, if most of the gold is centralized in the hands of the central bank or sovereign government, and is no longer redeemable to most participants for gold, then the amount of currency in the system is not at all constrained by the amount of gold in the system. The narrower the path is regarding the redemption of currency for gold, the less constrained the currency creation system will be by gold. As will be discussed in Part 4 of this book, most new currency is created from either 1) monetized government deficit spending, or 2) an increase in fractional reserve bank lending. If fractionally reserved commercial banks hold cash reserves at their central bank, and issue loans as a money multiplier on top of that monetary base, then gold held by the central bank or the government isn't really a constraint on how much currency is created over time. And to the extent that banks do experience liquidity issues from time to time, the central bank can create more base money, buy some of the bank's assets, and therefore keep the system growing.

From 1920 to 1950, the United States' official gold reserves grew from under 4,000 metric tons to over 20,000 metric tons. However, from 1950 to 1970 during the Bretton Woods system, the gold reserves quickly decreased from over 20,000 metric tons to just over 9,000 metric tons, due to redemptions by foreign central banks.[^159] And yet, also from 1950 to 1970, the amount of base dollars in the United States doubled, and the amount of broad dollars in the United States more than tripled. As this occurred from 1950 to 1970, dollars became exponentially less "backed" by reasonable amounts of gold.[^160]

This problem occurred because the U.S. domestic banking system, as well as the foreign dollar-denominated banking system (often referred to as the "Eurodollar" system) continued to grow, since the fractional reserve lending practices were completely disconnected from the amount of gold in the system. The Federal Reserve kept increasing the monetary base despite the Treasury not having enough gold to support it, and commercial banks kept multiplying those reserves into larger and larger amounts of dollar deposits. As a result, foreign central banks owned larger and larger amounts of dollars, and some of them redeemed those ever-increasing amounts of dollars for scarce gold. As American gold reserves rapidly drew down, some of those foreign creditors began to realize that the dollar wouldn't be able to maintain its gold peg for much longer, and therefore they started redeeming even more of their dollars for gold, accelerating the downfall of the system.

The Eurodollar system refers to U.S. dollar deposits that exist outside of the United States, and thus exist outside of direct control by the U.S. central bank. Despite the name, Eurodollars refer to dollars in any non-U.S. jurisdictions, rather than just dollars in Europe, although Europe was the starting point for the system. Beginning with the Marshall Plan in the late 1940s, considerable amounts of dollars began flowing into Europe. The Soviets also had dollars that they earned from trade, and due to the competitive nature between them and the United States, they often held their dollars in European banks rather than American banks, due to the risk of seizure.[^161]

Through the 1950s and 1960s, the Eurodollar system kept growing. We can visualize this as a fractional reserve system built on a fractional reserve system. The Federal Reserve, in its role as the country's central bank, serves as the "bank of banks" in the United States. Domestic U.S. commercial banks hold their cash reserves as ledger entries at the Federal Reserve, while the various retail and corporate depositors hold their cash deposits as fractionally reserved ledger entries at a commercial bank. So, there are two tiers of money, referring to base money and broad money. From there, a foreign bank can collect dollar deposits, keep them on deposit with a U.S. bank, and offer fractionally reserved bank deposits to various foreign entities. This is a third tier of fractionally reserved IOUs for dollars.

From the perspective of the foreign depositor, they hold a chain of fractionally reserved liabilities that leads all the way back to the Federal Reserve. The foreign depositor's dollar assets are liabilities of the foreign commercial bank that they are depositing at. The foreign commercial bank holds their cash assets (which represent a fraction of their customer deposits) at a U.S.-based commercial bank, and those dollar assets represent liabilities for that U.S.-based commercial bank. The U.S.-based commercial bank holds its cash assets (which represent a fraction of their customer deposits) at the Federal Reserve, and those dollar assets represent liabilities for the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, can see the total number of deposits at all domestic US banks, but has limited transparency into what is happening with the third tier --- all of those foreign dollar claims.[^162]

Those fraction-of-a-fraction deposits represented redeemable claims for gold by foreign central banks. And yet this process of money creation was completely unconstrained by the amount of American gold reserves held in Fort Knox. As even a small percentage of these numerous dollars were redeemed for gold, it quickly began to drain those gold reserves.

As the amount of domestic and foreign dollars grew and the United States' gold reserves shrank, the U.S. federal government could buy time due to its military and geopolitical power. If some countries redeemed too much gold, the U.S. federal government could quietly pressure them and suggest that they shouldn't keep it up. "Do you want us to remove our military bases from your country, and leave you militarily exposed to the Soviets? No? Then maybe stop redeeming so much gold and challenging our monetary system\..."

However, math is math, and some of the more assertive leaders of nations realized the inevitable downfall of this system and kept redeeming dollars for gold anyway. By the late 1960s, the system was already broken, and in 1971, President Nixon officially ended the redeemability of dollars for gold to foreign central banks to stop the downward spiral in U.S. gold reserves. At the time, he blamed speculators and said that the closed period of redemption would be temporary, but as the reader surely knows, it became permanent.[^163] The Bretton Woods system was poorly designed from the start and destined to inevitable default, and it only took about a quarter-century to do so from its conception in 1944, and barely over a decade from its launch and full operation in 1958--59.[^164]

At that point in 1971, the world entered the modern fiat currency regime, meaning the world reserve currency and other currencies are not redeemable for anything.
