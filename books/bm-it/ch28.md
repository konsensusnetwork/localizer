# Chapter 23: **The Lightning Network**

As of this writing, the most relevant layer on top of the Bitcoin base layer is called the Lightning network. The Lightning network consists of a series of smart contract channels that run on top of the Bitcoin base layer.

Individual consumer payments make a lot more sense with channels rather than being broadcast out to everyone. If you and I do an in-person physical cash transaction, it's directly peer-to-peer; we don't shout our transaction to the whole world. Lightning replicates that cash concept on top of Bitcoin's base layer and was enabled by the 2017 soft fork called SegWit.

The result is a much faster, more scalable, cheaper, and more private global payment system, albeit with some trade-offs and limitations compared to directly using Bitcoin base layer transactions.

Channel-based payments for Bitcoin have been conceptualized since the early innings of the network. From there, the original white paper on the Lightning network was written in 2015, and the first implementations of it for use with real bitcoin came out by early 2018, months after the SegWit update was activated.[^347] Developers purposely restricted their software's channel size early on, to grow cautiously and test things out safely in those early years.

The network has been functioning and growing ever since, and by late 2020 the network reached a level of liquidity, usability, and critical mass that became quite interesting to me from a macroeconomic perspective. I began to cover it in my research at that time, and over the few years since then it has continued to grow rapidly.[^348]

**The Limitation of Broadcast Networks**

Using a broadcast network to buy coffee on your way to work each day is a concept that doesn't scale well. A blockchain is meant to be an immutable public ledger. Do you really need to broadcast your coffee transactions to tens of thousands of nodes around the world, to be held in a distributed database for the rest of humanity?

Imagine, for example, if every email that was sent on the internet had to be copied to everybody's server and stored there, rather than just to the recipient. Even if we could anonymize them and thus factor out the privacy issues with that, it would be grossly inefficient. And yet, that's how various high-throughput, big-node blockchains try to work regarding money.

Instead, what if I can open a channel on top of the broadcast network, pay for things that only me and the merchant know about, and then close the channel, with no immutable public record of those individual payments having occurred?

A network that tries to scale transaction throughput on the broadcast-oriented base layer by radically increasing the block size and/or block speed makes no sense in terms of decentralization. The node requirements become absurdly high, which turns the network into a centralized, enterprise-scale database with just a handful of massive nodes. Changes can be made to the fundamental rules of the system at any time with the agreement of a handful of major node-running enterprises, and therefore all network rules including the supply of coins becomes changeable, and it becomes easier to censor transactions. Privacy becomes very hard; various entities could track your net worth and payment history, which is bad enough in a benign environment but outright terrible in an authoritarian environment, which is where half the world lives.

Additionally, a channel transaction will almost always be faster than a broadcast transaction, since it inherently requires propagation time to go through a broadcast network, even among the blockchains with the fastest block times.

That's why every blockchain that attempts to scale transaction throughput too much on a base layer with a shared global state is inherently flawed. Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and other coins like this all sacrifice too much and become too centralized, to do something that doesn't make technical sense in terms of scalability or privacy.

The only way scaling makes sense, and avoids sacrificing decentralization, is to use a layered approach. As described in the prior section, users can then pick their own solution, meaning the layer or layers that make sense for them, depending on their specific needs.

**Lightning Network 101 Explanation**

Suppose you and your friends are spending a long evening at an expensive restaurant. Rather than pay for every plate or drink, most restaurants give you whatever you order throughout the experience and charge you at the end in one big transaction. However, that relies on the restaurant trusting you to some degree.

Suppose instead that the restaurant collects your credit card information at the start of the meal, and then anything you order gets added to your tab. At the end of the night, the waiter gives you the receipt, you sign it, and then they charge the credit card that you already provided.

By doing this, you and the restaurant have opened a payment channel with each other. There is a moment of friction when setting up the tab and a second moment of friction when closing the tab, but between those moments, there is no payment friction for individual plates or drinks because you just need to tell the waiter what you want, and it comes.

That's how the Lightning network works conceptually, but without using credit. I can open a channel with you, using a base layer Bitcoin transaction. This channel is a 2-of-2 multi-signature time-locked channel, meaning that we both must agree to open it, but thanks to the time lock it's designed so that either one of us can unilaterally close the channel if we need or want to (although it's faster and easier if we do a cooperative close). While the channel is open, we can transact back and forth any number of times instantly --- as long as we have sufficient liquidity in the channel --- until one or both of us decides to close the channel with another base layer Bitcoin transaction.

Unlike a restaurant tab, a Lightning channel is not based on credit. The money is locked into the channel when the channel is created, and the rules are enforced by the decentralized global software. Payments within the channel are updated within seconds, and the ongoing tab can be enforced by either party closing the channel to reconcile with the base layer, with each side receiving their current balance. There is no debt, no promise to pay later, from one person to another. It's like instantly transmitting money to the restaurant's account through the channel every time you order something. The only indirect form of credit is the limitation in how many channels can be closed per unit of time due to Bitcoin's finite block space, meaning that not every Lightning channel can close within a short period of time. There's also an on-chain transaction fee associated with closing a Lightning channel.

Now, suppose that we take this a step further. Alice has a tab with the restaurant, and another person at another table, Bob, also has a tab open with the same restaurant. If Bob has spent all his money but realizes he has to pay an Uber to get home, Alice can tell the restaurant to deduct funds from her tab and give some money to Bob. Alice can pay Bob through the restaurant, or Bob can pay Alice through the restaurant, despite the fact that Alice and Bob know nothing about each other and have no direct payment channel open with each other. What they share is that they both have a payment channel open with the restaurant.

The Lightning network does that too, on a bigger scale, and without credit. Figure 23-A is an example diagram. If user A wants to send a payment to user P, she can do it by routing the payment from A to C to E to J to L to P. Each node in the middle might charge a tiny routing fee, perhaps a fraction of a penny, since it's easy to automate. She doesn't need to set up a channel directly with user P.

Since the Lightning network uses onion routing technology, the nodes in the middle don't necessarily know where the payment originated from or where it is going for its destination. Node J for example is told "route this payment from E to L" without being told more than it needs to know.

The result of this network of channels is that one base layer transaction to open a channel gives you access to many individual payments to various separate entities, and thus Bitcoin can be scaled rather significantly.

Imagine a global system with a massive number of interconnected Lightning nodes. Anyone can enter the network with a new node and start creating channels. Alternatively, many custodial services also give their users access to the network through their nodes and channels.

Since the network is efficient, transaction fees are often the equivalent of a penny or less. This allows for microtransactions and frequent machine-to-machine transactions. Artificial intelligence programs can control a bitcoin wallet, bitcoin-related Chaumian e-cash tokens, or a Lightning channel (a permissionless, open-source activity) far more easily than they can run a bank account (a permissioned, closed-source activity). A sufficiently advanced program that is assigned to perform a set of tasks can generate a wallet, earn or be given some bitcoin, and then determine that it needs to spend that bitcoin in productive ways as a step toward completing the task. For example, this could take the form of buying additional cloud-based processing power, buying access to certain APIs or data, or similar types of activities. Given sufficiently advanced programming, the scope for what machines might pay each other for is challenging to contemplate at this time, and the speed and efficiency with which the Lightning network potentially allows that to happen is unparalleled.

There is no hard limit to how big the Lightning network can get over time, and how many transactions per second the network can handle, other than the fact that opening and closing channels result in base layer transactions. The Lightning network, if it gets to a size of having millions of open channels in the future, can theoretically handle an almost unlimited number of peer-to-peer transactions per second, but there is an upper limit on how many channels can be opened or closed within a given period of time, depending on what percentage of Bitcoin base layer transactions are used for opening and closing Lightning channels.[^349] Future developments could allow more participants to share a channel, and thus could substantially raise the effective scaling ceiling. Custodians, including typical account-based financial services companies as well as ones using more automated and permissionless Chaumian mint e-cash technology, can already allow many people to share the same Lightning channel and thus scale the network to billions of people, but they require trust from the users.

Although it has some constraints, especially in this early development phase, this type of network makes a lot of sense for payments. Peer-to-peer channels are better than broadcast networks for small individual transactions or connections between separate payment ecosystems. They're fast, cheap, and relatively private.

Plus, the network can do micro-payments that are much smaller than what payment networks like Visa and Mastercard can do. With Lightning, a user can send payments worth pennies or less. This opens new use-cases that aren't possible with credit cards, for example, such as rapid machine-to-machine payments, or the usage of micro-payments as a spam-prevention technique.

All of these capabilities, including the base layer and channels opened on top of the base layer, are global and permissionless. Users can just do it, without asking the permission of a bank or other central entity. To prevent it, governments would need to actively tell their citizens that it's illegal to use certain types of benign, free, open-source software that are lightweight enough to run on a basic laptop --- and then figure out how to enforce that.

**Implementations and Apps**

Much like the Bitcoin network itself, no company controls the Lightning network.

The foundation of the network is an agreed-upon minimal protocol, which developers of Lightning node software adhere to if they want to operate with each other and the network. These standards are kind of like basic email standards or basic internet standards for various applications to communicate with, and they survive for as long as the network effect around the protocol remains robust.

Lightning node software is referred to as a Lightning implementation. Lightning Labs, Blockstream, ACINQ, and Block, Inc. are the businesses developing the four main Lightning implementations that various developers make use of as of this writing, but there are others out there as well.

If you want to be hands-on, you can choose which implementation to use, customize an implementation, or even build your own implementation from scratch. Since it is an open-source protocol, there is no gatekeeper to stop anyone from building their own Lightning implementation and using it to interface with the rest of the network.

From there, many companies can incorporate these Lightning implementations into easy-to-use apps. An end-user won't typically use a Lightning implementation directly; they will use a mobile app that allows them to connect with the network and obscure most of the technical details from them, including the details of the Lightning implementation under the hood.

**Liquidity and Network Effects**

Liquidity is the biggest limitation of a network that relies on individual routing channels.

If there are only hundreds of participants, then it could be hard to find a route that connects any two arbitrary nodes and has enough liquidity on each channel in the path to pass the payment through. A lot of attempted payment routes will fail. The funds won't be lost, but the transaction will fail to initiate. The network will be limited, and the user experience will be poor.

Once there are tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions of participants, and with larger average channel balances, there are many possible paths between most points on the network; routing a payment from any arbitrary point to any other arbitrary point on the network becomes much easier and more reliable.

In the Lightning network, the larger the payment that you want to send, the harder it will be to find a set of channel paths that collectively have enough liquidity to handle that payment. For example, it's easy to send the equivalent of \$25 between two points on the network, because your software merely needs to find a set of interconnected nodes that end up each having at least \$25 worth of liquidity in the direction that you want. However, it's harder to send the equivalent of \$2,500 to many destinations, because there are fewer channels with that much liquidity, and instead your payment may need to be split up and sent in parallel through multiple paths, and so there needs to be many possible paths between your node and the target node. Additionally, the target node itself may simply not have enough total inbound liquidity to receive a payment of that size.

The more channels that exist, and the bigger the channels are, the more reliable it becomes to route larger payments.

Due to this dynamic, the Lightning network wasn't a light switch that could just be turned on and work perfectly from day one. It had to be painstakingly built, channel by channel, for years. The early users were developers and early adopters with high conviction working their way through a difficult-to-use network, and only after they spent years working on it did it become relevant for a typical user who just wants cheap and fast payments.

Furthermore, tools had to be built along the way to make it easier for node operators to manage liquidity optimally. Those have gotten better but it's still a work in progress. Notably, the quality of liquidity can be even more important than the amount of liquidity in a channel network. There are measurements like the "Bos Score" that rank nodes based on not just their size, but also their age, uptime, proximity to other high-quality nodes, and other measures of reliability. As Elizabeth Stark of Lightning Labs has described it, the Bos Score is like a combination of Google PageRank and a Moody's credit rating.[^350]

So far, Lightning has been an important enhancement to the Bitcoin network, since it has given users the option for much faster payments that make use of the security of the underlying Bitcoin base layer. I expect it to continue to improve, and over time I think that additional protocols like Fedimint will further enhance the Lightning network's ease of use for non-technical users.

In time, we'll see which other layers and scaling methods may be developed and become widely adopted to fulfill a broader set of use cases.
