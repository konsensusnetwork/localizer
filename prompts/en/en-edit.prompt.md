### Introduction

In September 2022, a wave of normal people robbed banks in Lebanon.

What made these events more newsworthy than typical bank robberies was that most of these people were only robbing the banks to get their *own money* back. Due to a financial crisis in Lebanon, banks were not letting people access their own cash deposits for a long time.

One of the "bank robbers" that made headlines was a young woman who worked as an interior decorator. She held up a bank in Beirut using what later turned out to be a realistic-looking fake gun, to withdraw her family's savings for the treatment of her cancer-stricken sister, since the savings had been frozen by the bank. This was perhaps the most striking example, but there were several other bank robberies during this period by people who just wanted their own deposits back, and some of them used real weapons.

These events in Lebanon are specific to a certain country and time, but they are part of a global story.

Nigeria, a country with over 200 million people, has experienced 13% annualized inflation over the past decade.[^1] They launched a central bank digital currency called the eNaira in 2021, which so far has had extremely low adoption, while cryptocurrencies (especially bitcoin and U.S. dollar stablecoins) have seen an order of magnitude higher adoption rate within the country despite being cut off from the country's banking system. The Nigerian government subsequently deployed a set of policies meant to reduce the availability of physical cash and push people toward digital payments, which contributed to a period of political turmoil and riots.

Egypt abruptly cut its currency's value in half relative to the U.S. dollar in autumn 2016, which eviscerated years of savings for a population of approximately 100 million people. In 2022 and 2023, the country again performed multiple sharp devaluations of its currency relative to the dollar, resulting in yet another halving of the exchange rate. I know people in Egypt that buy physical U.S. dollars on the black market and hold them as protection from this ongoing problem. They pay significant conversion fees to do this, while earning no interest on the paper dollars they hold. And when these devaluations occur, it immediately puts the onus on all employees in the country to try to negotiate higher salaries to recoup some of their lost purchasing power, since their ongoing salaries are denominated in the devalued local currency.

Türkiye and Argentina, both members of the G20 nations and with a combined population of over 130 million people, have been dealing with runaway inflation in recent years. Türkiye reached 85% year-over-year inflation in 2022 and Argentina reached well over 100% inflation in 2023.[^2]

In the 1990s, Brazil experienced outright hyperinflation while it was the fifth most populous country in the world. When people imagine hyperinflation, they often picture 1920s Germany or certain failed states today, but a surprisingly large number of countries went through it at one point or another during the latter half of the 20th century. Just since the 1980s or later, people in Brazil, Argentina, Yugoslavia, Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Poland, Kazakhstan, Peru, Belarus, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Lebanon, and several other countries have experienced hyperinflation. Other countries such as Israel, Mexico, Vietnam, Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Türkiye experienced triple-digit inflation (i.e., nearly hyperinflation) within that period.

From 2016 to 2021, many bond markets in wealthy nations across Europe and Japan were offering near-zero or even negative nominal yields, and there was over \$18 trillion worth of negative-yielding bonds at the peak.[^3] People had to pay for the privilege of lending to governments and to large corporations rather than receiving interest for doing so. The incentives of the financial system were therefore turned upside down. And then over the next few years, a global inflation wave severely reduced the purchasing power of the holders of those bonds.

Throughout the 2010s, multiple senior members of the U.S. Federal Reserve repeatedly said that the economy was below their average inflation target for too long and that they wanted higher inflation. During a congressional hearing in early 2021 when the headline U.S. inflation rate was 1.7%, the chairman of the Federal Reserve was asked by a congressman about the 25% year-over-year surge in the broad money supply (the highest since the 1940s) that had occurred due to recent fiscal stimulus efforts, and any potential implications it might have for inflation or the value of the dollar. The chairman dismissed these concerns, saying that such a surge in the amount of broad money likely wouldn't have important economic implications and that we may have to "unlearn" the idea that monetary aggregates have an important impact on the economy.[^4]

As price inflation began to seriously emerge later in 2021, the chairman initially brushed it off as being transitory and the Federal Reserve continued expanding the base money supply with quantitative easing. But then, as four-decade high rates of inflation emerged during 2022, the chairman and other leaders of the Federal Reserve panicked and completely changed their monetary policy, citing price inflation as the biggest problem to deal with. In their attempt to quell inflation, they raised rates so aggressively --- and reduced the base money supply at a record pace over the next year --- that they ended up creating over a trillion dollars' worth of unrealized losses for banks on their Treasury securities and other low-risk assets. By sucking deposits out of the banking system at such an aggressive rate, they contributed to some of the largest bank failures in American history. By 2023, banks across the country had severely impaired capital ratios due to the sharply rising interest rates. For the first time in modern history even the Federal Reserve itself was running an operating loss due to paying such high interest rates on its liabilities relative to what it was earning on its assets.[^5] These Federal Reserve decisions affect the monetary conditions for 330 million Americans and billions of people in foreign countries and yet are made manually and subjectively by a group of just twelve people.

There are approximately 160 different currencies in the world[^6], each with a local monopoly over their own jurisdiction, and most of them have little or no acceptance outside of that jurisdiction. The global financial order is practically a barter system in this regard. A handful of top currencies are held as reserve currencies by other central banks and enjoy some degree of foreign acceptance, but they lose value slowly over time and have interest rates that haven't kept up with inflation for years. Most of the other currencies are more prone to sharp devaluations, persistent periods of double-digit inflation, and occasional hyperinflations, while enjoying little or no foreign acceptance. For people in countries that are in the second group, they often try to get their hands on foreign currencies such as dollars to protect their savings, and generally can't trust their local banks to hold them.

It can be a challenge to save money even in the most stable monetary jurisdictions, and if someone happens to be born in the "wrong" jurisdiction, it's an incredible uphill battle.

How did we get to this point? Why isn't our money *better* than this?

The global financial system has been broken for developing countries throughout modern history, and in recent decades it has built up serious imbalances even for developed countries. It's no longer solid at its foundation, in part because its core technology is outdated.

I contend that the rise of populism throughout the United States, Europe, and several developing countries ever since the 2008 global financial crisis is in large part due to this fact. People on both the left and the right of the political spectrum can sense that something is wrong, that things are "rigged" against them, but can't quite put their finger on why. A big piece of the puzzle is that the financial system as we know it isn't working anymore.

We've seen in prior decades that global financial orders gradually fall apart due to the buildup of economic imbalances, the occurrence of geopolitical realignments, and the introduction of new technologies. When that happens, the old order gets partially or completely reconstructed and rebuilt into a new order, and examples of such occurrences are provided in this book. Most signs suggest that the financial order that we have been in since the 1970s is reaching its later years and is beginning its process of reconstruction and realignment.

This is a book about money through the lens of technological developments. It covers the evolution of money in the past, why the current technology and institutions we use for money are failing us in the present, and some of the possible solutions to the monetary problems that we now face. It's written in plain language and is modular in its design, so that readers can focus on the parts that interest them the most.

**Part 1** of the book walks the reader through ancient ledgers and commodity monies, to analyze why money emerged naturally and why certain monies outcompeted others. This helps us discern what the ideal properties of money are, and why these properties tend to reemerge time and time again independently throughout history. It also explores the relationship between social credit and commodity money to provide a reconciliation for two economic schools of thought that are often in opposition.

**Part 2** is about early proto-banking services and the rise of full-service banks. It examines how various technological developments sped up monetary transactions and abstracted them away from the slower process of physical monetary settlements, which came with many benefits but also some drawbacks. It finishes by discussing how the increasing speed gap between transactions and settlements at the dawn of the telecommunication age gave considerable power to banks and central banks, since they became the primary entities capable of quickly transmitting money around the world.

**Part 3** describes the global financial system as it has been structured since the early 20th century, including the geopolitics behind its creation and how it has changed over time. It covers the period of failing gold pegs around the time of World War I, the Bretton Woods system that existed from the 1940s to the early 1970s, and the Eurodollar/Petrodollar system that replaced it from the 1970s to the present. Finally, it explains how some troublesome aspects of the current version of the system have led to structural imbalances around the world in recent decades.

**Part 4** analyzes the details of how money is created within the modern financial system and how debt inherently destabilizes the system over time. It then examines some of the imbalances and problematic incentives caused by constantly devaluing monetary units, as savers try to maintain purchasing power by buying other non-monetary assets instead. It shows how lawmakers have been empowered with a flexible public ledger to engage in warfare without taxation, to perform selective bailouts through the devaluation of other peoples' savings, and in general to finance expenses in opaque ways.

**Part 5** looks at digital monetary innovations in the 21st century, including Bitcoin, stablecoins, smart contracts, and central bank digital currencies. This is the most speculative part in the book, because it's about the present and future, rather than about the past. It describes some of the new technologies that are available to us, and specifically looks at the various trade-offs and risks that these technologies come with alongside the opportunities that they can provide.

**Part 6** explores the ethics of money and communication, which are the two components of commerce. It discusses the role of cryptography in general (a critical piece of modern banking and internet infrastructure), open vs closed financial networks, and the intersection of financial technology and human rights.

At its core, money is a ledger. Commodity money serves as a ledger governed by nature. Bank money serves as a ledger governed by nation states. Open-source money serves as a ledger governed by users. As the book explores, the evolution of technology changes the prevailing power structures and incentives surrounding money from era to era.

My background consists of a blend of engineering and finance, and I use a systems engineering approach when analyzing various aspects of the global financial system. Systems engineering is a multidisciplinary field that focuses on the design, integration, operation, and maintenance of complex systems over their life cycles. I treat the global financial system as the engineered system that it really is, and I have found that this method of analysis arrives at fresh conclusions that sometimes challenge conventional economic thinking.

My goal for writing this book is to help people better understand how money works, and why the global financial system is not functioning as well as it used to. The book is not just about why our financial system is not working well this year or this decade, but rather it is a deeper analysis of what money is, how we got to where we are now, and what the current foundational problems are.

I don't have all the answers and can't tell you what the world of finance will look like in the decades ahead, but what I aim to do in this book is to share what I've researched so that it may empower readers to find more answers for themselves. Politics can affect things locally and temporarily, but technology can affect things globally and permanently, which is why I analyze money primarily through the lens of technology.

This is not a gold book, not a banking book, not a bitcoin book, and not a political book. Instead, it is an exploration of monetary technologies in their myriad forms of the past, present, and future and touches on all of these topics and more, so that we might better understand where we came from and which paths we may take going forward.

### Part 1

**What is Money?**

"*The precursors of money, along with language, enabled early modern humans to solve problems of cooperation that other animals cannot --- including problems of reciprocal altruism, kin altruism, and the mitigation of aggression. These precursors shared with non-fiat currencies very specific characteristics --- they were not merely symbolic or decorative objects.*"[^7]

### Chapter 1: Ledgers as the Foundation of Money

Many people think that money as a concept starts with something like coins or shells, but the story really begins before that. It begins as a ledger.

A ledger is a summary of transactions and is used to keep track of who owns what. The oldest known written ledgers date back over 5,000 years to ancient Mesopotamia in the form of clay tablets. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, Sumerian is the oldest known type of writing in existence, and the oldest known instances of Sumerian writing were clay ledgers that kept track of commodities.[^8] They showed pictures of various commodities and had dots next to them that represented quantities. In other words, the first ideas that humans are known to have written down with their early proto-scripts were lists of ownership, credit, or transactions.[^9]

But ledgers as a concept can be even simpler than that. And prior to the invention of writing, they must have existed to some degree in memory and in oral form. Anytime somebody owed something to someone else, either formally or informally, they were inherently maintaining a basic oral ledger.

At the simplest level, with a modern example, let's imagine two child siblings named Alice and Bobby. They are old enough that their parents task them with chores, and as they grow and start to lead more complex lives, occasionally they need to rearrange their schedules. Alice, for example, might need to skip chores one night so that she can go out with her friends. To do this, she can offer to her brother Bobby that if he covers her chores today, she'll cover his chores tomorrow. As he accepts the offer, they have just created a basic mental ledger and a form of credit. Alice now owes Bobby a specific set of chores. This is enforceable only through trust and reputation: If Alice does not repay her debts, then Bobby will likely refuse future trades. If it remains simple enough, their little ledger will be a verbal one only, but if their schedules get complex enough and they trade around chores on a regular basis, they might use a calendar as a written ledger. There is no specific monetary unit associated with this ledger --- it's just a barter system. The only units involved are individual chores. The ledger merely keeps track of individual chores that are swapped over time, as a form of credit.

We can also imagine a group of hunters, perhaps tens of thousands of years ago in a tribe somewhere, counting how many kills they each had made, or loosely keeping track of who did whom a favor. Tribes throughout the world had (and still have) various ways of selecting leaders formally or informally, and the process is often meritocratic to some degree. Whether intending to or not, people approximately keep track of deeds and reputations of others, to see who provides the group with a surplus and who is a burden.

Early human social groups generally consisted of dozens of individuals, forming a band. Various bands within a geographic area, with a closely related culture, would then often recognize themselves as being part of a larger interconnected tribal culture. Within a group where everyone knows each other, money isn't needed, aside from oral and memory-based ledgers. Favors can be loosely tracked, and it is usually clear who is pulling their weight and who isn't. Groups of this nature would typically consist of kinships and friendships, so the exact "score" didn't need to be tracked. The ledger would be approximate, loose, and flexible.[^10]

Back in my engineering days, a subset of my colleagues and I often went out to lunch together. We loosely kept track of who drove the small group each time, so that we could roughly balance it out. It wasn't written down, and it wasn't exact, but there was indeed a rough mental ledger that we collectively kept track of. The same was true for driving co-workers to the mechanic or to the airport and having the favor returned later (before ride-sharing apps were commonplace), or lending someone a bit of cash in a moment where they were short on it (for example, when splitting a cash restaurant bill, which used to happen more often back in those days). These favors were never phrased in terms of "I'll do this for you now, but you have to reciprocate in the future." Rather, such a favor was happily provided as a gift when asked for, and then it would be assumed that if a reciprocal favor was asked for later, that it would be happily returned.

Considerable research by anthropologists on hunter-gatherer tribes has found similar gift-oriented behavior as a recurring theme. While cultures of course vary substantially, individuals that know each other generally give gifts or favors and then naturally expect sharing in return.[^11] That's a big piece of what friendship is.[^12]

The situation becomes more difficult once we start interacting with people we don't know well, and that we either don't trust or that we may never see again. If two groups encounter each other in a primal environment, for example, it introduces the risk of violence, but it also opens the possibility for trade.

Spot trading is an obvious first step to transacting with people we don't know well. Rather than extend them a form of informal gift credit like we would do with our family and friends, we ideally want to finalize any transaction *on the spot*, since there's a high likelihood that we'll never meet them again. Two groups encounter each other, both of which have resources but also some capacity for violence, if need be, and through basic language or gestures they complete a trade. Perhaps one band has an excess of spears but needs furs, and the other band has an excess of furs but needs spears. They can trade furs for spears on the spot, and both groups are better off. Anthropologists have documented multiple instances of ritualized trade between different hunter-gatherer groups, often involving the prospect for mating as well.

If there is not already an established ritual process between relatively equal groups in the region, and instead some parties come across each other more haphazardly, there is a high probability that a trading attempt will fail, due to not fulfilling the "double coincidence of wants." A double coincidence of wants is an economic description that means that for the trade to be successful, each party must have an excess of what the other wants. If both parties are short on spears, the trade will fail. If both parties are short on furs, the trade will fail. There are more combinations that lead to a failed trade than a successful one.

It's much easier to trade with our friendly band members than to trade with strangers, because with family and friends we have the luxury of trust and time, which we can consider a form of flexible social credit. Someone can ask me for a favor, and I can do it for them, even if there is absolutely nothing that I want from them now. I could have all the excess food, furs, and tools I need, and yet when someone I know has a shortage of something or needs me to spend time helping them with something, I can do them a favor and provide it.[^13]

In addition to it feeling good, the reason I would extend this gift-credit to someone I know is because I anticipate that eventually there will be a time when I need something. Maybe I will become ill or injured or pregnant and unable to collect food for some time and will then rely on the person I am giving a favor to now. By providing a surplus of favors, I increase my social standing and thus my social safety in the group. The same logic applies in modern times when helping friends, neighbors, and family. Of course, I likely won't be thinking so mechanistically when I perform a favor; I may simply do it because I'm biologically wired to feel good when I help someone out, due to thousands of generations of biological selection for this trait that led my ancestors to survive and thrive as intelligent and generous social animals. But in the back of my mind, the conscious mental calculations are inevitably there as well: By doing this favor I am strengthening the whole group, including myself, and I am banking some personal insurance or social savings for myself and/or my close kin in the future. I'm expending current work or resources during my time of abundance and in return I am collecting some savings in our collective social ledger. This social credit, this informal mental ledger, is the friend-and-kin group solution to the "double coincidence of wants" problem. With flexible social credit, we can easily help each other when one person needs something even if the other person currently needs nothing.

In a 2010 study called "Wealth Transmission and Inequality Among Hunter-Gatherers," that referenced a wide variety of existing literature, the researchers noted that social insurance can in some cases be based on the reputation of the person in need and the quality of their social network:

> Most adults in hunter-gatherer societies actively contribute to food production and processing, as well as tool manufacture and maintenance. In addition, child care and provisioning is generally a parental duty. Most of these forms of labor require considerable strength and stamina, visual acuity, and other aspects of good health. As a result, we expect somatic wealth to be of prime importance to success and well-being. On the other hand, those who suffer periodically from suboptimal somatic endowments can usually rely on aid from others in the form of food-sharing, assistance with child care, and protection in disputes. This social insurance is normative and widely available, but some evidence suggests that the quality of such aid will vary according to the "relational wealth" (reputation, size and quality of the social network) of the needy individual or household (Gurven, et al. 2000; Wiessner 2002; Nolin 2008).[^14]

Early in the famous movie *The Godfather*, a man asks Vito the mob boss for a favor, and Vito agrees to do it for him. The price Vito asks for in return, rather than money, is an unspecified favor sometime in the future. In other words, he wants flexible social credit. This is because this man needs something from Vito, Vito needs absolutely nothing from this man now, and yet Vito knows the man and recognizes that the man is part of his wider community. Vito is in the business of collecting favors and then calling them in when it is advantageous to him. Later in the movie, Vito indeed calls in the favor; he develops a need that this man is uniquely suited to provide, and it was a need that Vito didn't have early in the movie. Vito's story is of a man who tries to maximize his family's relational wealth by maintaining an extensive ledger of favors, with these favors serving as a form of credit-based currency in the mob's shadow economy.

Going back to our trading example between separate bands of people, since they lack this option of flexible social credit or ledgers (they don't trust each other and might never see each other again after this meetup), what could they bring to a trade that they expect to have a very high likelihood of being wanted by the other party? If I was in their situation, could I think of something to bring that almost everyone wants, all the time? In other words, is there a good that is the most sell-able? For many tribes, an early answer was shells.

Shells, especially ones that were carved and polished into jewelry beads, emerged as money-like assets thousands of years ago in multiple different regions. The utility was aesthetic: They could be fashioned into bracelets, made into belts, used as earrings, sewn into clothing, or hung in the hair. The advantage of shells in trade is that they are small, scarce, and long-lasting. And the specific advantage of putting them onto wearable strands is that they don't have to be carried in the hands, which makes them portable.

In his 2002 essay, "Shelling Out: The Origins of Money," Nick Szabo elaborates with extensive detail on the reasons why shells and other collectible proto-money likely came to be. As he summarized in his abstract:

> The precursors of money, along with language, enabled early modern humans to solve problems of cooperation that other animals cannot --- including problems of reciprocal altruism, kin altruism, and the mitigation of aggression. These precursors shared with non-fiat currencies very specific characteristics --- they were not merely symbolic or decorative objects.[^15]

On the Pacific coast of North America, tribes collected dentalium, which refers to long shells that look like teeth. They served a role as money and were traded as far inland as North Dakota. As naturally occurring tubes with openings on each end, dentalium were strung together in long strands, and certain tribesmen would have tattoos on their arms that they used as reference lengths when measuring strands in transactions. Some tribes specialized in collecting these from deep waters.[^16]

On the Atlantic coast, a different type of shell called wampum was used. These were made from clam shells and required extensive polishing and using a bow drill to create small holes in them for stringing together. The creators of these shells typically didn't consider them to be "money" as such. The beads were honored for having once been living creatures and were often used for ceremonial purposes, like crafting into priceless belts to honor treaties and other big events. But other tribes, and even colonialists, did begin to use these as money, or stores of value and status. Inland tribal groups collected them extensively.[^17]

In parts of Africa and Asia bordering around the Indian Ocean, cowrie shells were used as money for similar reasons. International traders would bring cowrie shells with them for trade, and there is extensive documented history of this practice up through recent centuries.[^18]

Although shells were among the most common proto-monies, there were other types of bead monies as well. Beads made from ostrich eggs, or strings of teeth from large predatory animals like lions or wolves, sometimes filled a similar role. In "Shelling Out," one of Szabo's examples is of the !Kung:

> Like most hunter-gatherers, the !Kung spend most of the year in small, dispersed bands and a few weeks of the year in an aggregate with several other bands. Aggregation is like a fair with added features --- trade is accomplished, alliances are cemented, partnerships strengthened, and marriages transacted. Preparation for aggregation is filled with the manufacture of tradeable items, partly utilitarian but mostly of a collectible nature. The exchange system, called by the !Kung *hxaro*, involves a substantial trade in beaded jewelry, including ostrich-shell pendants quite similar to those found in Africa 40,000 years ago.

As one might expect, the African continent is home to the oldest known beads. At the Blombos Cave archeological site in South Africa, small snail shells with tiny holes in them were found and were estimated to be 75,000 years old. The U.S. National Science Foundation reported on this find in 2004:

> Perforated shells found at South Africa\'s Blombos Cave appear to have been strung as beads about 75,000 years ago --- making them 30,000 years older than any previously identified personal ornaments. Archaeologists excavating the site on the coast of the Indian Ocean discovered 41 shells, all with holes and wear marks in similar positions, in a layer of sediment deposited during the Middle Stone Age (MSA).
>
> \"The Blombos Cave beads present absolute evidence for perhaps the earliest storage of information outside the human brain,\" says Christopher Henshilwood, program director of the Blombos Cave Project and professor at the Centre for Development Studies of the University of Bergen in Norway.
>
> The shells, found in clusters of up to 17 beads, are from a tiny mollusk scavenger, Nassarius kraussianus, which lives in estuaries. They must have been brought to the cave site from the nearest rivers, 20 kilometers east or west on the coast. The shells appear to have been selected for size and deliberately perforated, suggesting they were made into beads at the site or before transport to the cave. Traces of red ochre indicate that either the shell beads themselves or the surfaces against which they were worn were coated with this widely used iron oxide pigment.[^19]

Food decays, and so in a world without freezers, people don't have an incentive to keep much more food than they need. Similarly, spears and furs are bulky to carry around; beyond a certain point, there isn't much value to having too many extra spears and furs. Trading with other tribes with these things is difficult because each side needs to have precisely what the other side wants. But having carved and polished shell beads fixes the problem. They don't rot and they aren't bulky, so it's fine (and even desirable) to collect extra of them whenever peoples' other needs are met. They're nearly universally desired in a world with that basic level of technology. Even if someone doesn't like wearing them, their spouse or sibling or friend might. And they know members of most other tribes like them, which opens future trading opportunities.

Creating carved and polished shell beads was a very labor-intensive process. The shells first had to be collected by hand on the coast, and then depending on the type, they were carved, polished, and manually drilled into with a bow drill so that a thread could be run through them to affix them together or onto something else, making them into a useful ornament. Once made, these shell beads lasted a long time, and had a lot of value relative to their size and weight due to their attractiveness and the amount of work that it took to make them. If someone trades excess food for some shell beads, or spends surplus time creating shell beads, they could hold onto the shell beads for months or years until they come across something that they want or need and trade them for that thing. And in the meantime, they are wearable and aesthetically pleasing.

In other words, the shell beads serve as something that can be accumulated, that can augment or replace the need for flexible social credit, and that can replace the oral ledger --- at least when it comes to dealing with people that are not trusted or might never be seen again. Shell beads, as a nearly universally desirable and durable good, allow someone to trade with people even if they need nothing from them, because they can always just request shell beads that act as a placeholder until they do come across something they need or want. And they can always use more shells than whatever number they currently have, because they represent portable, stored-up value that they can trade away for resources in the future, either with their own bandmates or with other groups. Compared to food that decays, or furs and spears that are too bulky to hoard or carry, these small wearable shells arguably represent the invention of long-term savings technology --- meaning a way to convert surplus time or resources into a financial battery. People can keep some strands of shell beads on their wrists, some on their neck, some on their ankles, some in their hair, some as a belt, etc. People can put them on their kids or give them to their spouse. Each small piece of shell jewelry is intrinsically desirable and represents quite a bit of work.

In this role as the most sell-able ("salable") good, each strand of shell beads acts like one of Vito's unspecified future favors. Someone or some group that has collected a lot of shell beads by spending surplus time and resources to accumulate them (or who inherited them from the prior generation who did) now has plenty of value to offer if they need more immediate resources in the future. And unlike a favor, a strand of shell beads represents final settlement; its ongoing value does not depend on the memory of the one who received the favor.

In addition to someone simply enjoying wearing shell beads for their own aesthetic sake, shell beads were often a sign of status. Someone with a lot of shell beads had a lot of wealth, literally and socially. In this tribal context, if we see someone covered in beautiful shell belts, bracelets, necklaces, and sewn into their clothes, we can assume they must have provided a lot of value to others in the past to have accumulated so many shell beads, or that they are closely connected to other people that have. They are literally wearing a bunch of valuable stored-up favors on their person, and thus have enjoyed a significant period of surplus resources. This seems like a good person to get to know, to respect, and possibly to mate with. They're socially signaling that they've had a past filled with abundance.

In the study mentioned previously --- "Wealth Transmission and Inequality Among Hunter-Gatherers" --- the researchers noted that moveable property was usually individually owned in hunter-gatherer societies, while land tended to be more communally owned:

> Moveable material property, such as tools, clothing, and valuables, is generally treated as individual property and is often transmitted to descendant kin. In most foraging societies, however, such property can usually be manufactured by any adult of the appropriate gender, or obtained fairly readily; exceptions include items involving highly specialized manufacture or obtained through limited trade contacts, as well as wealth and prestige goods in some sedentary and less egalitarian societies.[^20]

Notably, "items involving highly specialized manufacture" and "prestige goods" are identified as among the types of property that are not readily obtainable. In other words, they have actual scarcity to them. The researchers went on to conclude that, while generally communal in many aspects, hunter-gatherer societies in general are not necessarily as egalitarian as we may imagine them to be:

> Indeed, as detailed in the introductory paper in this forum by Bowles et al., β=0.25 implies that a child born into the top wealth decile of the population is 5 times more likely to remain in the top wealth decile than a child whose parents were in the bottom decile. Even a β of 0.1 implies that a child born into the top wealth decile is twice as likely to remain there as is one born into the bottom decile. These results suggest that in hunter-gatherer populations, even those with extensive food-sharing and other leveling devices (Cashdan 1982), the offspring of those better off will tend to remain so, and conversely.[^21]

Unlike a literal ledger, no party in the transaction knows what the full ledger of shell beads looks like. If you and I are involved in a transaction, neither of us knows exactly how many shell beads exist in our region. But we do know their properties and how hard they are to make, and we know how often we see them worn by others, which helps us judge their rarity and what we could consider trading for them.

Shell beads, and commodity monies more broadly, serve as nature's decentralized ledger. By handing shells to someone else in exchange for something of value, we update the state of the ledger, and it is by physical possession that the full state of the ledger is maintained and updated. All participants understand and interact with parts of this natural ledger, but none of us know the full ledger state.

Who controls this ledger? For the most part, the answer to that question is "nature." And in practical terms, that means no human or group controls it. Making shell beads requires expending energy and time --- in the right way with the right materials --- which means nobody can cheat. Some coastal participants could spend their surplus time directly making shell beads, whereas other inland participants could spend their time accumulating other surplus resources, and then trading some of those surplus resources for shell beads. Either way, shell beads were a measure of surplus time and resources, a measure of savings and value, and often with a lot of ceremony attached to the process.

For the remaining part, or the edge case, the answer to who controls the ledger is that whoever has the most advanced technology controls the ledger. This commodity money ledger system works if all participants are somewhat equal in productive capability, which was the case for much of the world for thousands of years. If an extremely advanced civilization comes from across the ocean and has specialized metal tools, and they figure out how the shell money system works, then they can probably make an order of magnitude more shell beads per unit of work than anyone else. They can therefore devalue everyone's shells by flooding the market with them, and they can collect a lot of resources in the process because it will take time for the tribes to realize that this new civilization can churn out shells much faster than anyone else, and that shell beads in general are becoming less rare and less valuable over a period of months or years due to this rapidly expanding supply.

As we'll see in the next chapter, the story of commodity money is a story about technological progress. Various commodity monies serve as honest and fair ledger systems up until technology reaches a point where one group gains an unequal advantage, which then forces everyone else to adapt or lose.

### Chapter 2: **The Evolution of Commodities as Money**

As the prior chapter explored, humans in small kinship and friendship groups don't need money; they can organize resources among themselves manually, with informal oral ledgers at most. They can keep track of who offers a repeated surplus to the group and who always seems to be operating at a deficit. Within small groups, people naturally "solve the problem of barter" with flexible social credit before the problem of barter even comes up.

However, groups that regularly trade with outside groups, or develop farming and begin to reach larger static populations than the typical tribal size, inevitably start identifying and making use of some form of money, which gives them a more liquid, divisible, portable, and widely accepted accounting unit for storing and exchanging value with people they don't know. In addition to still using social credit systems, they also rely on nature's ledger, so that they can sidestep the double coincidence of wants that would otherwise reduce the success rate of trading.

The usage of collectible proto-monies, since they take so much labor to produce, often seems arbitrary to outsiders of that culture. Why spend so much time making shell beads, for example? Isn't that a waste of resources, in a harsh, low-technology, hunter-gatherer environment where every resource is valuable and where more than a third of children don't even make it to adulthood? Shouldn't surplus time be spent on something else? The answer is that this work is a good use of resources during periods of abundance, and ends up more than paying for itself, because a standardized and credible medium of exchange and store of value makes all other economic transactions more efficient.

As an economy becomes more complex, there are a greater number of possible combinations of barter between different types of goods and services. For example, if an economy produces five different products, then there are 10 different unique trading pairs. If an economy produces 20 different products, then there are 190 unique trading pairs. An economy with 100 different products has 4,950 unique trading pairs. At this point, most types of barter other than for the basics would be wildly inefficient.

So, if a society requires more complex or trustless interactions than flexible social credit will allow, then that society requires some standard unit of account --- or money --- that serves as one side of the trading pair with every other good or service.

Specifically, among the assets that a society trades, one or two of the most scarce, divisible, durable, portable, and liquid tend to rise to the top. An apple farmer that needs some tools (a blacksmith), meat (a cattle rancher), repair work (a carpenter), and medicine for her children (a doctor), can't spend the time going around finding individuals that have what she needs, that also happen to want a ton of apples at that moment. An extensive barter system like this between neighbors doesn't develop naturally. Instead, she simply needs to be able to sell her (highly seasonal and short-lived) apples for some durable and widely accepted savings unit that she can use to buy those things with over time as she needs them.

In 1776, Adam Smith discussed the emergence of money as a solution to the barter problem in his *Wealth of Nations.* Credit theorists object to this example and order of events around the topic of barter in general, but that objection and the broader debate around it are addressed in detail in Chapter 4 of this book. After Smith's exploration of the topic, commodity money as a detailed topic tends to be heavily emphasized by those in the Austrian school of economics, founded by Carl Menger in the 1800s, and further advanced by Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, and many others.

In this way of thinking, money should be divisible, portable, durable, fungible, verifiable, and scarce. It also usually (but not always) has some utility. Different types of money can be thought of as having different "scores" along those metrics:

- Divisible means that the money can be sub-divided into various sizes that are suitable for different sizes of purchases.

- Portable means that the money is easy to move across distances, which means it must pack a lot of value into a small weight.

- Durable means that the money is easy to save across time; it does not rot or rust or break easily.

- Fungible means that individual units of the money don't differ significantly from each other; one is as good as any other.

- Verifiable means that the seller of the goods or services for the money can easily check that the money really is what it appears to be.

- Scarce means that the money supply does not increase quickly.

- Utility means that the money is intrinsically desirable in some way; it can be consumed or has aesthetic value, for example.

Summing those attributes together, money is the "most salable good" available in a society, meaning it's the good that is the most sell-able --- the most capable of being sold. Money is the good that is most universal, in the sense that people want it, or realize they can trade for it and then easily and reliably trade it for something else that they do want. In his article "On the Origin of Money," Menger described that an ideal money transports value across both space and time, meaning that it can be transported across distances efficiently or saved for spending in the future.[^22] In addition, a key aspect of salability is liquidity, meaning that someone should be able to buy or sell large amounts of it relatively easily, and without losing much value to wide price spreads or lack of sufficient trading volumes. Liquidity in many ways is a measure of acceptability: The more widely accepted and widely held something is, the more liquid the trading for it tends to be.

Scarcity is often what determines the winner between two competing commodity monies. However, it's not just about how rare the asset is. In fact, extreme rarity can be bad for liquidity and make a commodity into a bad (unsalable) form of money. An important concept to be familiar with here is the stock-to-flow ratio, which measures how much supply there currently exists in the region or world (the stock), divided by how much new supply can be produced in a year (the flow).

For example, gold miners add about 1.5% new gold to the estimated existing above-ground gold supply each year,[^23] and unlike most other commodities, most of the gold does not get consumed; it gets repeatedly melted and stored in various shapes and places.

Gold does not rot, rust, or corrode as readily as most other materials do. It is chemically inert and therefore barely forms any compounds. It can be re-melted countless times and can even be dissolved in certain types of acid and then filtered back out. It can be blown up and scattered, but those pieces don't rust into nothingness like other materials would, and therefore the pieces are retrievable. Other than trace amounts that are thrown out in electronic circuit boards or sunk to the bottom of the ocean in shipwrecks, most gold ever mined is still in human control (and even those lost gold amounts are technically retrievable, at the right price). It's practically indestructible.[^24]

The combination of continuously mining gold and rarely losing any of the mined gold has resulted in gold having a stock-to-flow ratio of about 100/1.5 = 67 on average, which is the highest stock-to-flow ratio of any commodity. The world collectively owns 67 years' worth of average annual production, based on estimates by the World Gold Council. The supply growth rate has varied between 1% and 2% over the past century, which is a remarkably low and narrow band.[^25] Even in the 1970s when gold went up by an order of magnitude in terms of its dollar price, it couldn't affect the annual supply growth as a percentage of existing holdings by much at all. Prior to that point, the only periods where the refined gold supply increased at an accelerated rate were when industrial societies found a new continent and explored easy deposits, or if they invented new techniques for profitably extracting previously uneconomical deposits.

If an asset has a monetary premium on top of its pure utility value, then market participants are strongly incentivized to try to make more of it. Only assets that are highly resistant to increases in supply relative to the total existing supply can withstand this challenge, and thus can become and remain widely accepted money on a global scale.

On the other hand, if an asset is so rare that barely anyone has it, then it may be extremely valuable if it has utility, but it has little use as money; it's not liquid and widely held or accepted, and so the frictional costs of buying and selling it are high. Certain atomic elements like rhodium for example are rarer than gold but have low stock-to-flow ratios because they are consumed by industry as quickly as they are mined. A rhodium coin or bar can be purchased as a niche collectible or store of value, but it's not useful as widely accepted societal money and therefore doesn't arise as such naturally. The same is true for meteorites or other unusually rare things. As of 2022 there have been 1,878[^26] known meteorites discovered in the United States, and there are tens of thousands that have been found in other jurisdictions, which makes meteorites rare and valuable collectibles but not good money. Things like rhodium bars or meteorites simply don't have enough liquidity or divisibility to be useful as money.

So, a durably high stock-to-flow ratio tends to be the best way to measure scarcity for something to be considered money --- along with the other attributes on the list above --- rather than absolute rarity. A commodity with a high stock-to-flow ratio is hard to produce, and yet a lot of it has already *been* produced and is widely distributed and held, because it either isn't rapidly consumed or isn't consumed at all. That's a relatively uncommon set of attributes and what allows something to be money rather than merely a collectible.

Throughout history various stones, beads, feathers, shells, salt, furs, fabrics, sugar, coconuts, livestock, copper, silver, gold, and other things have served as money. They each have different "scores" for the various attributes of money and tend to have certain strengths and weaknesses. It was often the case that at least two monies were widely used at a time because no single money could fulfill every role perfectly.

Salt for example is divisible, durable, verifiable, fungible, and has important utility, but is not very valuable per unit of weight and not very rare, so doesn't score very well for portability and scarcity. The word "salary" comes from the Latin word *salarium* which referred to a salt-denominated income.

Gold is the best among just about every metric and is the commodity with the highest stock-to-flow ratio by far. The one weakness it has compared to other commodities is that it's not very divisible. Even a small gold coin is more valuable than most purchases and is worth a tremendous amount of labor. It's the king of commodities. Gold, as an ideal form of ornamentation, is basically a more technologically advanced version of shell beads. Its most common application is to serve as wearable or displayable wealth across many different cultures. It is money that we can easily bring with us and that we can use to signal our social status to others.

For a large portion of human history, silver has been the winner in terms of everyday usage. It has the second-best score after gold across the board for most monetary attributes, including the second highest stock-to-flow ratio, but beats gold in terms of divisibility, since small silver coins are ideal for daily transactions. It's the queen of commodities. And like in the game of chess, the king may be the most important piece, but the queen is the most useful piece.

As a result, gold was often held by the wealthy as a long-term store (and display) of value and as a medium of exchange for very large purchases, while silver was the more tactical money, used as a store of value and a medium of exchange by most working people. A bimetallic money system was common in many regions of the world due to gold's limited divisibility, despite the challenges that come with that multi-money approach.

Why did gold and silver defeat all other commodity monies to reach the modern era as usable money? The answer is that these were the two that could maintain high enough stock-to-flow ratios against the rise of human technology, even with a substantial monetary premium placed on them. They could retain their rarity over time, while also being widely accepted, widely held, durable, portable, divisible, and re-combinable.

The purchasing power of a commodity money can be conceptually divided into two parts: utility value and a monetary premium above that utility value. The utility value is the actual usage of that commodity for an economic purpose (consumption or production), while the monetary premium is an additional value that it has because so many people hold it as a form of savings, for lack of anything better to hold. The difference between a normal commodity and a commodity money is that people holding units of a commodity money are not just using it for its end purpose; they are holding it as savings because it's a highly salable good that they can easily resell in the future. Non-monetary commodities such as crude oil are for the most part measured only in terms of their utility value. There is practical demand and there is production supply, and relatively few others are holding oil for any significant amount of time. The dominant commodity monies of a region such as gold, however, have excess demand on them from widespread holding by people who are not end users, which greatly increases the total market value of that commodity. People hold a gold coin not because they want to do anything with the coin, but because they know that gold has many purposes and that by holding some, they are saving value in something that has a lot of liquidity and global acceptability.

This monetary premium (this excess price above the utility purpose) serves as a massive and permanent advertisement for people to try to figure out how to make more of that commodity. Only the scarcest commodities, meaning those with the highest stock-to-flow ratios, can withstand this advertisement over the long run. Monetary premiums can be applied to other assets as well, such as waterfront properties or fine art, because they are often held more so as a form of savings than to be enjoyed for their own sake. The downside with that approach is that such non-monetary assets inherently lack the portability, liquidity, fungibility, and divisibility of gold and other monies.

Many people consider money to be a shared delusion. In this way of thinking, a society can pick anything it wants as money, as long as most of its members believe in it. Paperclips could be money, for example, if we all agree that they are. While this seems true at first, it's not sustainable. If the supply of that money can be rapidly expanded, then everyone's savings can be rapidly diluted. And a monetary premium provides a lot of incentive for people to make more of it, if possible. Therefore, if a money is not selected wisely within a society, it only takes a small number of individuals to break free from their society's shared delusion to realize that its money isn't scarce, and make a lot more of it to extract value from everyone else. Alternatively, people from a different society can exploit that society's shared delusion. Therefore, the only types of money that can maintain usage in a society for a long period of time are ones with a significant degree of genuine scarcity to them.

Shell money lasted thousands of years in various regions, but eventually became unworkable against the industrial revolution. Furs, livestock, salt, tobacco, and other monies also served their useful roles at various times, but the ever-growing technical prowess of civilization eventually made those unworkable as money as well. They worked until technology disallowed them from continuing to work. The following sections walk through several examples for this concept.

**Shells**

As previously described, shell money was used for long stretches of time in parts of the Americas, Africa, and Asia. In some areas it was used more ceremonially, and in other areas it was used more literally in the transactional sense as money.

The wampum variety of shell beads that was common on the east coast of North America was the more ceremonial variety by the original tribes that developed it. Nonetheless, New England colonialists incorporated it into their money system in the early 1600s, with a fixed exchange rate of a certain number of shells equaling their coins.[^27] Purple wampum was rarer and thus was given twice the value of white wampum.

Eventually the fixed exchange rate laws were repealed, and wampum was valued on a market basis. John Campbell opened the Campbell Wampum Mill in New Jersey in 1812, and with modern drilling techniques, they were able to mass produce wampum beads at a much faster pace than they could previously be produced at.[^28] John Jacob Astor of the American Fur Company purchased this industrially produced wampum and used it to trade for furs with indigenous populations in Canada.

In the long arc of time, shell money in all its forms and geographies across the world became unworkable against the power of industry. Metal tools and other technologies made shell money an unsuitable medium for storing value. In some areas to this day, the tradition of making wampum by hand is kept alive by descendants of the indigenous people that used it, returning it to its more ceremonial and nuanced purposes as a way of preserving cultural tradition.

**Tobacco**

In the early 1600s, Virginia, Maryland, and North Carolina began using tobacco as money, including as government-decreed legal tender. Over time, however, problems began to emerge with that system that were similar to the industrialization of wampum shells.

Since tobacco had a monetary premium placed on it above its utility value, there was a massive incentive to plant more of it and to try to capture (and therefore eventually erode) that monetary premium.[^29] Unlike gold, tobacco doesn't have enough natural scarcity to prevent that monetary premium from being exploited and dissipated. The natural result of this monetary premium was a major increase in the supply of tobacco, and this led to major price inflation for goods and services in tobacco-denominated terms. In response to this excess supply of tobacco, colonial governments enacted restrictions on the planting of tobacco, such as by limiting production to certain groups, to create artificial scarcity in what is otherwise not scarce on its own.[^30] In other words, only groups favored by the government could act as the "tobacco money printer." This is clearly an imperfect solution, and a hard one to maintain indefinitely.

Another problem was that tobacco is not perfectly fungible. There are higher and lower qualities of tobacco. If all tobacco is valued at a certain exchange rate, then there is a strong incentive to spend the lowest quality tobacco locally, and to sell the high-quality tobacco overseas where it is more appropriately valued. As a result, warehousing began to occur, where tobacco would be stored and graded, with standardized paper claims issued against it. They therefore created a "tobacco standard" system. For the holder of the paper receipt, this created counterparty risk in addition to the existing risk associated with the devaluation of the underlying tobacco.[^31]

Overall, the problem with tobacco was that it could not withstand the invitation to produce more of it, and a monetary premium is a major invitation to try to create more of something. It's a very heavy burden for any commodity to carry. Gold has been able to withstand that challenge for thousands of years, but tobacco could not. Tobacco served a useful role for some time in the southern colonies because they were small and poorly developed in their early years and lacked sufficient specie, but the tobacco monetary system no longer made sense once they grew larger and more developed. Various attempts by government to prolong the useful life of this money delayed its inevitable demise for a period, but eventually the system became clearly unworkable relative to sounder types of money and was discarded entirely.[^32]

**Cocoa**

Throughout parts of central and southern America, civilizations used cocoa as money. This practice was in effect when Europeans arrived, and murals show that it dated back many centuries earlier.[^33] Cocoa beans are small, relatively fungible, and can be stored for a decent amount of time. Most importantly, people love the taste! These traits made cocoa a decent form of money.[^34]

Like many pre-industrial societies, these civilizations engaged in flexible social credit and barter, and that practice trends toward using one or two highly salable goods as a method to improve trading. One or two scarce and liquid goods tend to become money in contexts where credit is not sufficient. Aztecs also had copper money, with units being molded into the shape of a decorative hoe or decorative dull axe. Thousands of cocoa beans could be traded for one of these copper units, if someone needed to engage in larger transactions or store liquid wealth in a small and portable unit for a longer period.[^35]

When Europeans arrived in the Americas, they engaged in the use of cocoa and copper as money, but like other places in the world, this practice was eventually displaced by more scarce forms of money.

**Rai Stones**

Inhabitants of an island in the South Pacific called Yap used enormous stones as money. These "rai stones" (or "fei stones") were carved into circular discs of stone with a hole in the center, and came in various sizes, ranging from a few inches in diameter to over ten feet in diameter. Many of them were at least a couple feet across, and thus weighed hundreds of pounds. The biggest were over ten feet across and weighed thousands of pounds.[^36]

Interestingly, I've seen this example used by both an Austrian economist and an MMT economist. The reason that's interesting is because those two schools of thought have very different conceptions of what money is. Austrian economists tend to emphasize money as a commodity, whereas Chartalists (and MMT economists in their current form) tend to emphasize money as a public ledger.[^37] These views can be reconciled by understanding that commodity monies are being used as a ledger, with nature serving as the administrator of that ledger. That reconciliation is discussed more in Chapter 4.

What made these rai stones unique was that they were made from a special type of limestone that was not found on the island. Yap islanders would travel 250 miles to a neighboring island called Palau to quarry the limestone and bring it back to Yap.

They would send a team of many people to that far-away island, quarry the rock in giant slabs, and bring it back on wooden boats. Imagine bringing a multi-thousand-pound stone across 250 miles of open ocean on a wooden boat. Some people died in this process over the years. It required a tremendous amount of time, effort, and danger.

Once made into rai stones on Yap, the big ones wouldn't move. This is a small island, and all the stones were catalogued by oral tradition. An owner could trade one for some other important goods and services, and rather than moving the stone, this would take the form of announcing to the community that this other person owned the stone now.[^38]

In that sense, rai stones were a literal ledger system, and not really that different from our current monetary system. The ledger keeps track of who owns what, and this particular ledger happened to be orally distributed, which of course can only work in a small community.

By the time this was documented by Europeans, there were thousands of rai stones on Yap, representing generations of quarrying, transporting, and making them. Rai stones thus had a high stock-to-flow ratio, which is a main reason for why they could be used as money.

In the late 1800s, an Irishman named David O'Keefe came across the island and figured this out. And, with his better technology, he could easily quarry stone from Palau and bring it to Yap to make rai stones, and thus could become the richest man on the island, able to get locals to work for him and trade him various goods. An article for the *Smithsonian Magazine* by Mike Dash called "David O'Keefe: The King of Hard Currency" summarized it as follows:

> As the Irishman got to know Yap better, he realized that there was one commodity, and only one, that the local people coveted --- the "stone money" for which the island was renowned and that was used in almost all high-value transactions on Yap. These coins were quarried from aragonite, a special sort of limestone that glistens in the light and was valuable because it was not found on the island. O'Keefe's genius was to recognize that, by importing the stones for his new friends, he could exchange them for labor on Yap's coconut plantations. The Yapese were not much interested in sweating for the trader's trinkets that were common currency elsewhere in the Pacific (nor should they have been, a visitor conceded, when "all food, drink and clothing is readily available, so there is no barter and no debt"), but they would work like demons for stone money.[^39]

In essence, better technology eventually broke the stock-to-flow ratio of rai stones by dramatically increasing the flow. Foreigners like O'Keefe, armed with more advanced technology, could bring any number of them to the island, become the wealthiest people on the island, and therefore increase the supply and reduce the economic value of the stones over time.

However, locals were smart too, and they eventually mitigated that process. They began to assign more value to older stones (ones that were verifiably quarried by hand decades or centuries ago), because that subset remained scarce. Similar to how no matter how much new art is produced, Vincent van Gogh isn't making any more, and so his paintings tend to increase in price rather than get debased by new supply from other artists. Nonetheless, the writing was on the wall; rai stones weren't a great system for money anymore.

Things then took a darker turn. As further described in Dash's *Smithsonian* article:

> With O'Keefe dead and the Germans thoroughly entrenched, things began to go badly for the Yapese after 1901. The new rulers conscripted the islanders to dig a canal across the archipelago, and, when the Yapese proved unwilling, began commandeering their stone money, defacing the coins with black painted crosses and telling their subjects that they could only be redeemed through labor. Worst of all, the Germans introduced a law forbidding the Yapese from traveling more than 200 miles from their island. This put an immediate halt to the quarrying of fei, though the currency continued to be used even after the islands were seized by the Japanese, and then occupied by the United States in 1945.[^40]

Many of the stones were taken and used as makeshift anchors or building materials by Japanese invaders during World War II, reducing the number of stones on the island.

Rai stones were a notable form of money while they lasted because they had no practical utility other than for aesthetics. They were a way to display and record wealth, and little else. In essence, it was one of the earliest versions of a formal public ledger, since many of the stones didn't move and only oral records (or later, physical marks by Germans) dictated who owned them.

**Feathers**

Feathers were often used as money-like objects by tribes around the world. Majestic birds such as eagles or parrots, with unusually large or beautiful feathers, were collected by many cultures.

Sometimes these would have a more ceremonial value, such as eagle feathers used as headdresses among tribal leaders. Other times they would be collected more informally, simply for their beauty and interest, and then occasionally used in trades.[^41] A downside of feathers is that they are not very durable; over time it's easy to wear a feather down and ruin it --- especially if you're always on the move.

In the Solomon Islands, a form of feather currency was manufactured by tribal craftsmen into belt-like rolls. Each roll would consist of red feathers from hundreds of tiny scarlet honeyeaters, along with sap and other substances. This resulted in a more durable and unique form of feather money. Due to its nature, however, such a form of money is inherently limited in its fungibility and liquidity to a small jurisdiction, both geographically and culturally.

**African Beads**

Trade beads were used in parts of west Africa as money for many centuries, stretching back at least to the 1300s and prior. Various rare materials could be used, such as coral, amber, and glass. Venetian glass beads gradually made their way down to sub-Saharan west Africa through trade. One of the earliest documented references we have for this comes from Ibn Battuta, the famous Moroccan traveler of the 14th century whose exploratory trips took him all over Africa and Asia.

Emil Sandstedt, in his book *Money Dethroned: A Historical Journey* quoted Ibn Battuta, regarding Battuta's observation of West African money practices:

> A traveller in this country carries no provisions, whether plain food or seasonings, and neither gold nor silver. He takes nothing but pieces of salt and glass ornaments, which the people call beads, and some aromatic goods.[^42]

These were pastoral societies, often on the move, and the ability to wear your money in the form of strands of beautiful beads was useful. These beads maintained a high stock-to-flow ratio because they were kept and traded as money, while being hard to produce with their level of technology.

Eventually, Europeans began traveling and accessing West Africa more frequently, noticed this usage of trade beads, and exploited them. Europeans had glass-making technology and could produce beautiful beads with modest effort. So, they could trade tons of these beads for commodities and other goods (and unfortunately for human slaves as well).[^43]

Due to this technological asymmetry, Europeans devalued these glass beads by increasing their supply throughout West Africa and extracted a lot of value from those societies in the process. West Africans kept trading scarce local goods, ranging from important commodities to invaluable human lives, for glass beads that had far more abundance than they realized.[^44] As a result, they traded away their real valuables for fake valuables. Picking the wrong type of money like this can have dire consequences.

It wasn't quite as easy as one might suspect for the Europeans to accomplish this trick, however, because the Africans' preferences for certain types of beads would change over time, and different tribes had different preferences. This seemed to be like the experience with the rai stones, where once new supplies of rai stones started coming in faster due to industrial technology, the people of Yap began valuing old ones more than new ones. In this case, the West African tastes seemed to change based on aesthetics and scarcity. However, this practice also gave that form of money a lower score for fungibility, which reduced its reliability as a medium of exchange. Like rai stones, trade beads couldn't ultimately maintain their high stock-to-flow ratio in the face of technological progress, and therefore eventually were displaced as money.

**Japanese Invasion Money**

Although not a commodity money per se, Imperial Japan used weak money to acquire the scarce goods and services of regions that it had power over.

During World War II, when Imperial Japan invaded regions throughout Asia, they would confiscate hard currency from the locals and issue special paper currency in its place, which was referred to as "invasion money."[^45] These conquered peoples would be forced to save and use a currency that had no backing or supply scarcity and that ultimately lost all its value over time. This was a way for Japan to extract savings of their subjects while maintaining a temporary unit of account in those regions for economic transactions to continue to occur.

To a less extreme extent --- as I describe later in this book --- this is sadly what happens throughout many developing countries today: people constantly save in their local fiat currency that, every generation or so, gets dramatically debased, with their savings being siphoned off to the rulers and wealthy class.

**Grain**

In ancient Babylon, the silver shekel was used as a key monetary unit, but grain was also frequently used as a form of payment. Grain served as a food staple for the region, was often used to pay daily wages, and frequently served as a unit of account for other transactions.[^46]

The Code of Hammurabi, which is nearly four thousand years old, enforced grain as legal tender:

> 108\. If a wine-seller do not receive grain as the price of a drink, but if she receive money by the great stone, or make the measure of drink smaller for corn, they shall call that wine-seller to account, and throw her into the water.
>
> 111\. If a wine-seller give 60 KA of drink on credit, at the time of harvest she shall receive 50 KA of grain.
>
> 114\. If a man do not hold a debt of grain or money against a man, and seize him for debt, for each seizure he shall pay one-third mana of silver.
>
> 115\. If a man hold a debt of grain or money against a man, and he seize him for debt, and the one seized die in the house of him who seized him, that case has no penalty.[^47]

The difficulty of using an agricultural product for money is that the money supply changes dramatically throughout the year. Harvest season creates a lot of new grain money, and then throughout the rest of the year that grain supply is drawn down from people turning it into bread and beer. Farmers often relied on debt to make their payments, and then used their harvest (if successful) to pay off the debts to their creditors they had incurred throughout the non-harvest seasons.

In many societies like this, failed harvests could mean financial ruin for the farmer. The farmer and/or their family members could become debt-slaves. However, various kings would periodically forgive debts, or institute limitations on creditors either by excusing the debtor for certain events or by limiting the amount of servitude required to pay off debts.

> 48: If a man owe a debt, and a storm inundates his field and carry away the produce, or through lack of water grain have not grown in the field, in that year he shall not make any return of grain to the creditor, he shall alter his contract-tablet and he shall not pay interest that year.
>
> 117: If a man be in debt and sell his wife, son or daughter, or bind them over to service, for three years they shall work in the house of their purchaser or master; in the fourth year they shall be given their freedom.[^48]

Babylon provided among the earliest known examples of formalized weights and measures, formalized commodity money, formalized written credit, formalized custody contracts, and formalized legal tender. Kings set the foundational rules of commerce and addressed any structural imbalances in the system as they occurred throughout their reign, while temples served as the administrative systems for formalized commerce to occur.

**Video Game Money**

One of the fascinating outcomes of massively multiplayer online games is that they result in various unintended economic experiments. They basically re-run various economic environments with new rulesets, and this leads to case studies on emergent aspects of economies.

One well-known example of this was the emergent monetary formation in the online game *Diablo II*, which was an extremely popular multiplayer action-fantasy game released in the year 2000 that sold millions of copies (including to me as a teenager). Several people have analyzed the in-game economy over the years, but it was the author of *21 Lessons*,[^49] Gigi, who brought it to my attention with an article in 2022.[^50]

*Diablo II* had an in-game currency which (as we would expect in a fantasy setting) was called "gold." However, gold was programmed in such a way that inadvertently prevented it from being the best form of money in the game. Firstly, gold was abundant at high levels of play, but your game character could only carry a limited amount of it on their person. Secondly, whenever your game character died, you would lose a portion of the gold you were carrying, yet you could get all your other items back. Naturally with these limitations on gold, players wanted to store their wealth in valuable items instead.

Additionally, because it was a multiplayer game with many rare items (and ways to craft certain greater items from lesser items), players naturally wanted to trade with each other. There were druids, barbarians, paladins, sorceresses, and other classes of characters. Within those classes, each character could be customized differently, with multiple potential directions of skill development and gear. Therefore, some rare items that were useful to one player were not useful to another player, and a lively trading economy emerged as a result.

For barter to be successful, it requires satisfying a double coincidence of wants. If a barbarian and a sorceress meet up to trade items, it is likely that they will fail the trade. Perhaps he wants a mighty axe, and she wants a magical staff. Out of the hundreds of items in the game, what are the chances that they each will have specifically what the other wants?

To fulfill this need, a form of money other than in-game "gold" quickly emerged among the players. Naturally, some items inherently made for better money than other items due to their characteristics. Players had limits on how many item slots they may carry, and larger items took up more slots. So, a monetary item needed to be valuable relative to the amount of space it took up. Additionally, a monetary item needed be rather universally desirable; it couldn't be some niche item that only barbarians could use, but rather had to be something that most classes could use.

The answer in the first couple years of the game was that a rare ring called the Stone of Jordan ("SoJ" for short) became the widespread currency of *Diablo II*. The SoJ boosted the mana and all skills of a player who wore it, which made them useful to everyone, and especially to the various spellcaster classes for whom mana was a particularly important resource. A SoJ might or might not be the "best" piece of gear for a given character, but every character could make significant use of them, and for some characters it was indeed a top-tier item to wear. Beyond their use, however, SoJ's acquired a monetary premium, since many people would collect them as savings, and use them as a highly salable good for trading. They took up the minimum amount of space in terms of character carrying capacity, which gave them a high amount of value density. Rare weapons and gear were denominated in SoJs; a rare magical sword might be worth eight SoJs, and a rare magical bow might be worth five SoJs.

Therefore, a sorceress could acquire some rare items on her journeys, and sell them to other players for SoJs, which she would hold. If one day she meets a barbarian that happens to have the rare magical staff that she wants, she could trade the SoJs for the staff. The barbarian could then eventually find someone who has the mighty axe that he wants and trade the SoJs for it. That's much easier than trying to line up a direct trade of a specific magical staff for a specific mighty axe.

SoJs emerged naturally as money because they had the best characteristics of money out of the items in the game. They were not intended to be used as money by the game developers, and it's not as though the players got together in a meeting one day and arbitrarily picked them; through quick analysis and iteration, the fact simply emerged among millions of players that SoJs were the best in-game money. And once they became the game's money, SoJs had a depth of liquidity that other items didn't have. Many people had them as savings, and many people would accept them, and thus their salability was higher than that of other items. Most players wouldn't be able to cite the *The Wealth of Nations* or similar economic literature for their reasoning; they just intuitively understood that having an in-game money was useful to solve the problem of barter in a world without credit, and that rare, small, widely useful items were ideal for it.

The one shortcoming of SoJs is that they were quite valuable and not divisible. So, there were also items called "perfect skulls" that emerged as lesser money. They were small and widely useful, but not as rare. Five perfect skulls could be traded for a SoJ, and a varying number of SoJs could be traded for varying legendary magic weapons and gear. In other words, SoJs were like banknotes for big purchases, and perfect skulls were like coins for small purchases or change.

Eventually, players found bugs in the game that allowed them to duplicate SoJs, and so SoJs began flooding the market, and devaluing. The game developers attempted to identify the bugs and delete duplicated items, and so players would open the game and find that some of their SoJs had disappeared. SoJs ceased being good money beyond that point, like how many commodity monies were rendered obsolete by advances in technology. The "technology" of buggy duplication rendered SoJs into bad money.

When the *Diablo II* expansion came out, the game developers introduced additional items including runes. Runes could be inserted into various gear to make the gear more powerful and could be combined in specific ways to create entirely new gear. Runes were small, valuable, and widely useful, and there were different types with different rarities, which in practice could serve like differently sized banknotes. They emerged naturally as in-game money from that point on due to their high degree of salability.

This case study (and others like it) is basically an accelerated example of how monies can emerge in a society naturally due to their characteristics that make them the most salable good --- and then fall out of favor as conditions change.

### Chapter 3: **How Gold Won the Commodity War**

Within any society that uses a form of commodity money, the prior chapters showcased how it is nature that controls the ledger. Nature sets the boundaries for how hard the money is to make, and thus how resistant it is to debasement. Among participants that are of relatively equal technological development, nobody can cheat the ledger. Everyone must expend similar types of work to create new units of the money.

However, when an industrialized society encounters a pre-industrialized society, the industrialized society effectively controls the ledger of the pre-industrialized society. They have the technological capability to dilute the commodity money that the pre-industrialized society uses, whereas the reverse isn't true. The understanding of this capability takes time to spread through the pre-industrialized society, which unfortunately gives the industrialized society time to exploit the pre-industrialized society for their valuable resources.

The success or failure of various commodity monies therefore has a natural filtering aspect to it, with less-scarce monies gradually falling out of existence and the most-scarce monies remaining in existence. As the various human groups of our world encountered each other over time, the number of commodity monies in usage dwindled down to just a few.

Saving wealth in a non-ideal form of money and being unable to properly measure or understand the supply growth of the money that you use, can have dire consequences individually or as a society. This problem unfortunately extends into physical banknotes and electronic ledger systems as well, and indeed is amplified by those technologies, and this problem is described later in this book. After thousands of years, two commodities beat all the others in terms of maintaining their monetary attributes across multiple geographies: gold and silver. Only they were able to retain a high enough stock-to-flow ratio to serve as money and maintain a monetary premium, despite civilizations constantly improving their technological capabilities throughout the world over the ages.[^51]

Humans figured out how to make or acquire basically all the beads, shells, stones, feathers, salt, furs, livestock, grains, and industrial metals we need with our improved tools, and so we reduced their stock-to-flow ratios and they all fell out of use as money. However, despite all our technological progress, we still can't reduce the stock-to-flow ratios of gold and silver by any meaningful degree --- except for rare instances in which the industrialized world found new unmined continents to draw from, or invented new techniques like the gold cyanide extraction process.[^52] Gold has maintained a stock-to-flow ratio of between 25x and 100x throughout modern history, generally averaging around 50x or above, and briefly falling no lower than 16x during the Gold Rush in the mid-19th century[^53]. In other words, apart from the discovery of new continents or other one-time events, we historically can't increase the supply of gold by more than about 2% per year on a sustained basis, even when the price goes up more than tenfold in a decade like it did in the 1970s.[^54] Silver generally has a stock-to-flow ratio of 10x or more, which is still rather high.

Most other commodities have a stock-to-flow ratio that is below 1 or 2. Even the rarest elements, like platinum and rhodium, have rather low stock-to-flow ratios due to how rapidly they are consumed by industry.

Humanity has gotten better at mining gold with new technologies, but it's inherently rare and we've already tapped into the easiest surface deposits. Only the deep and hard-to-reach deposits remain, which acts like an ongoing difficulty adjustment against our technological progress. One day we might eventually break this cycle with drone-based asteroid mining or deep-sea mining or some similar science fiction level of technology, but until that day comes, gold retains its high stock-to-flow ratio. Those environments are so inhospitable that the expense to acquire gold there would likely be extremely high.

Basically, whenever any commodity money encountered gold and silver in the competition for money, it was always gold and silver that won. Other commodities could remain money for periods of time in specific regions, but gold and silver demonstrated the ability to compete globally as money and win each time. This is because whenever civilizations and monies would encounter each other, the holders of gold and silver had enough technological capability to devalue other forms of money, but the holders of shells, beads, livestock, salt, fabrics, and lesser metals could not devalue gold and silver.

**Precious Metal Coinage**

Authorities further enhanced gold and silver as money by creating standard units, generally in the form of coins. The minting of precious metal coins emerged in many regions, with Lydia (present-day Türkiye) being one of the earliest known civilizations to produce them, back in the 6th century B.C.

The advantage of coins issued by some widely recognized authority (which at the time would typically be a kingdom or empire) is that they can standardize units in terms of size, weight, and fineness, which makes commerce easier to settle. Arbitrary amounts of gold and silver would have to be weighed so that the metal could be used in individual transactions, whereas standardized unit sizes remove that step from the transaction process. The face of an emperor stamped on the coin, perhaps also with ridges along the edges to prevent shaving of the metal, adds a degree of verifiability regarding the quality and content of the coin. Even to this day, if you buy modern sovereign gold coins such as American Eagles, you'll have to pay a premium for them per ounce relative to a bigger chunk of gold, and people do so because they know they are getting real gold and they know they can easily sell them in the future.

Furthermore, a kingdom would typically assign legal tender status to such coins, and they would trade somewhat above their pure metal content and above the value of similar foreign coins in their jurisdiction due to having this assured acceptance and liquidity. In other words, we can think of legal tender precious metal coins as having three layers of value. The first layer of value is the content of the precious metal itself. The second layer of value is the verification and convenience premium that coinage provides compared to raw bits of metal, which applies to both domestic and foreign coins to varying degrees. The third layer of value is a liquidity premium that only domestic coins have due to their wide (and often mandated) acceptance and recognition by merchants in the jurisdiction as legal tender. Wages and prices denominated in coined units tended to be somewhat "sticky," meaning that they took some time to change throughout society even if the supply of precious metals or coin supply varied within a short period of time.

These layers of value were repeatedly abused over the ages. Governments, finding their budgets unable to balance due to war or greed or mismanagement would eventually give in to the temptation of debasement. For example, a king can collect 1,000 pure gold coins in taxes, melt them down and make new coins that are each 90% gold (with the other 10% being made from some cheap filler metal), and spend 1,111 gold coins back into the economy with the same total amount of gold. They look rather unchanged to most people; wages and prices are rather slow to change; and the king may even force them to be accepted at their prior unit of account, such as by determining the unit in which he pays his soldiers. Years later, if the king still has deficits, he could re-melt his incoming tax revenue and make them 80% gold and spend 1,250 of them back into the economy. And if that's still not enough, he (or his successors) could reduce them to 70% gold, and so forth.

At first, these slightly debased 90% gold coins would often be accepted for the face value that they previously had, especially if enforced through legal decree. This is because the unit itself is partially abstracted from the underlying metal.[^55] As the coins circulated for longer and in greater numbers due to dilution, it would become obvious and much harder to enforce their prior value. Prices would go up and peoples' wages and savings would decline in value, as they pay taxes from their savings of purer money and earn their ongoing income in this newly debased money. Wages would push higher over time as people needed more coins to pay their expenses. Merchants would try to hold the purest gold coins and sell the diluted gold coins, and thus the fungibility of the whole monetary base would weaken, since coins would no longer be standardized at this point. Foreign merchants, outside of the jurisdiction of the government that mints the coins, would be quick to demand higher prices in these debased gold coins in exchange for their goods and services, valuing them more strictly for their metal content. The purest coins would eventually go out of circulation, from a combination of the king re-collecting them from taxes, from people hoarding them, or from foreign merchants taking them out of the jurisdiction.

Debasing coinage like this typically took years and decades. The silver Roman denarius, for example, was introduced as a small silver coin of over 95% purity in 211 B.C. It was then reduced in size and still over 95% silver. Briefly under the reign of Tiberius it was increased in purity, but by around 64 A.D. it further decreased in size and was less than 94% silver. It then remained at the same size for centuries but gradually declined in purity a few percentage points here and there. By the end it began to fall rapidly and was only around 5% silver by the year 274. Various wages, including government-paid wages, would not immediately change to take into account the slightly debased denarius each time, and so the emperor could get more value for his silver when initiating a devaluation.[^56] Over time, with more supply of coins on the market, prices would eventually push upwards, and soldiers would demand higher wages.

Eventually throughout the world, improvements in banking, which are described later in this book, reduced the need for coins, and improved gold's limited divisibility. People could deposit their gold into banks and receive paper credit representing redeemable claims on that gold. Banks, knowing that not everyone would redeem their gold at once, went ahead and issued more claims than the gold they held, beginning the practice of fractional reserve banking.[^57] The banking system then consolidated into central banking over time in various countries, with nationwide slips of paper representing a claim to a certain amount of gold.[^58]

During that era from the late 19th century to the early 20th century, gold finally won out over silver in terms of usage as money. Silver lost some of its monetary premium and therefore devalued relative to gold, compared to the thousands of years prior.

In his book *Globalizing Capital: A History of the International Monetary System*, Barry Eichengreen explains why a gold standard won out over silver: it was mostly an accident. In 1717, England's Master of the Mint (who was none other than Sir Isaac Newton himself) set the official silver-to-gold ratio too low, according to Eichengreen.[^59] As a result, most silver coins went out of circulation and gold became the unquestioned coin of the realm.[^60] Then, with the United Kingdom rising to dominance as the strongest empire in the 19th century, the network effects of the gold standard, rather than the silver standard, spread around the world, with most countries putting their currencies on a gold standard. Countries that stuck to the silver standard for too long, such as India and China, saw their currency weaken as demand for silver dropped in North America and Europe.

On the other hand, Saifedean Ammous, in his book *The Bitcoin Standard*, emphasizes the improved divisibility of gold due to banking technology.[^61] As previously mentioned, gold scores equal or higher than silver in most of the attributes of money, except for divisibility. Silver is better than gold for divisibility, which made silver the more day-to-day money for thousands of years while gold was mostly used by kings, merchants, and religious orders. The technology of banking systems and paper banknotes in various denominations backed by gold improved gold's effective divisibility. And then, in addition to exchanging paper, people could eventually "send" money over telecommunication lines to other parts of the world, using banks and their ledgers as custodial intermediaries. This was the gold standard --- the backing of paper currencies and financial communication systems with gold. There was less reason to use silver at that point, with gold being the scarcer and more durable metal with a higher stock-to-flow ratio, and now basically just as divisible as silver thanks to this second-layer abstraction.

I think there is an element of truth in both explanations, although I consider the explanation of Ammous to be more complete, starting with a deeper axiom regarding the nature of money itself. Banknotes made gold more divisible and thus the harder money won out over time, but network effects from political decisions can impact the timing and specific geographic spread of these sorts of changes.

Even after both gold and silver were demonetized by the global banking system in the second half of the 20th century, gold held its newly retained monetary premium over silver as an ideal form of savings. Gold used to trade at a 10x to 16x multiple of silver's value for thousands of years in multiple different geographies.[^62] Over the past century, however, the gold-to-silver price ratio has averaged around 50. Silver structurally lost a lot of its historical monetary premium relative to gold shortly after the introduction and deployment of bank ledgers linked by intercontinental telecommunication systems in the 1860s, and I don't think that's a coincidence.

Figure 3‑A[^63]

As gold and silver went out of use as a medium of exchange, silver's superior divisibility became nearly irrelevant. Gold's properties as a scarcer and more durable metal with a higher stock-to-flow ratio became the more relevant attributes for saving, and therefore gold likely absorbed some of silver's monetary premium. Central banks around the world still hold gold in their vaults, and many of them still buy more gold each year as part of their foreign exchange reserves. Holdings at that scale involve hundreds --- or even thousands --- of tons, and therefore gold's much denser value than silver comes in handy for these large and long-term savers. Therefore, although government-issued currency is no longer backed by a specific amount of gold, gold remains an indirect and important piece of the global monetary system as a central bank reserve asset. There is no better naturally occurring commodity to replace it.

If the best form of money has an inherent limitation --- such as gold's limited divisibility --- then it allows for multiple types of money to coexist. Bimetallic and even trimetallic standards were necessary for long stretches of time to fix gold\'s divisibility limitations. On the other hand, if the best form of money does not have a limitation, then the best money tends to become more dominant and crowd out all others. With neither gold or silver widely used as a medium of exchange anymore, but with both still being used as a long-term store of value, gold is the more attractive choice for most larger holders due to its better durability, higher stock-to-flow ratio, and more value per mass and volume.

To this day, both gold and silver maintain a significant degree of monetary recognition worldwide. While not widely accepted for payments, if I were to take some gold coins or gold jewelry with me to almost any country in the world, I could find a dealer or merchant to buy them from me in local currency at a reasonable market price, and usually without much difficulty. Physical gold in the form of coin, bar, or jewelry has remained one of the best ways people have available to them if they want to store value in a dense, liquid, and fungible bearer asset form with no counterparty risk.
