### Style guide

- When translating from English to {language}, avoid anglicisms and maintain the author’s intent through thorough analysis of the source text. Actively reformulate sentences, and choose words that suit the style of the book. Use synonyms strategically to prevent repetition without compromising meaning.
- Consistency in punctuation is critical. Place punctuation inside quotation marks according to local conventions and adopt uniform usage of commas, periods, and other punctuation marks.
- For cultural references, seek natural language equivalents that convey the same connotation without distorting the original context.
- Maintain an informal tone where it suits the book’s style, yet remain professional. Pay special attention to the flow of the text by varying sentence length and using linking words judiciously. Systematically correct double spaces and spelling discrepancies, adhering preferably to the official spelling rules for {language}.
- For complex economic concepts from the source material, opt for clear and accessible expressions without losing nuance. Technical terms retain their precision and, where necessary, include an explanation in context. You walk a fine line between academic accuracy and readability for a broad audience.
- Achieve cultural alignment by replacing typically American expressions with {language} counterparts carrying the same emotional weight. For historical examples or metaphors, identify parallel situations in history or society that local readers will recognize.
